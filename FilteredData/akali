Early Game

     
       "No one tells me what to do. Not anymore."
     
       "Cold steel and a target are all I need."
     
       "I love what I do, my enemies won't."
     
       "They can't stop me. I mean, they can try."
     
       "I work alone, it's better for everyone."
     
       "If they're smart, they're scared."
     
       "I am my own master. Just the way I like it."

Mid Game

     
       "Wars are messy. My kills are clean."
     
       "Everyone dies, I just speed things up."
     
       "You can never have too many kunai."
     
       "Don't waste the anger, channel it."
     
       "No more meditation or masters."
     
       "Youth and skill, every time."
     
       "Let 'em see me, they can't stop me."
     
       "The words on their tombstones will be my new mantras."
     
       "Kama or kunai? Depends how I'm feelin'."
     
       "It's not about the killing, it's about who's doing the dying."

Late Game

     
       "I make problems... disappear."
     
       "Can't stop what's comin'."
     
       "Gonna carve my own path."
     
       "Stay outta my way!"
     
       "Playtime's over."
     
       "How about I just end this."
     
       "Let's end this."
     
       "Let's make this quick."
     
       "Time to do what's gotta be done."
     
       "Skill and steel will get the job done."
     
       "You will not stop me!"

Long Move

     
       "The only rule that matters is that your enemies don't walk away."
     
       "If you look dangerous, you better be dangerous."
     
       "Restraint's not really my thing."
     
       "The Fist of Shadow was my mom. I do things differently."
     
       "Take one life at a time. Fast. Clean."
     
       "We're gonna do this my way - quick and deadly."
     
       "I'll make this look like magic."
     
       "Magic's fine, steel's better."
     
       "So many enemies, so many knives."
     
       "It's not the killing I'm about, it's the cause."
     
       "The Kinkou couldn't control me. I do what they wouldn't."
     
       "There are over 300 pressure points on the human body. No one can protect 'em all."
     
       "Everyone's got a weakness, that's my target."
     
       "Forget balance... this is a reckoning."
     
       "The rules hold you back, leave 'em for someone who needs 'em."

       "Look, I don't wanna kill you, but I will."
     
       "Still time for you to do the smart thing: go home."
