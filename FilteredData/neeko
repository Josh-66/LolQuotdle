       "Co-'om se-henna. Oh, it means like, um... 'we smile forever.' Friends! That is the word! Friends!"
     
       "I want to become everybody! Who says I cannot? I will prove them wrong! Then, I will become them. Last laugh? Neeko!"
     
       "This place tastes like many emotions. Excitement, anger, joy and... salty? Is salty a feeling?"
     
       "No more room for problems please. Only room for more cheesebreads."
     
       "People say 'The world is Neeko's oyster'. Is oyster a good thing? Taste like grapes?"
     
       "Sho'ma is like, um... the shape of someone's spirit, who they really are inside."
     
       "Why do people say "Blah blah blah first, ask questions later?" Neeko need answers now!"
     
       "Changing bodies is like changing minds. Easy. Neeko can do it! Everyone else make it difficult."
     
       "Words are tricky. Better to speak with colors and emotion!"
     
       "Every place is beautiful. Every place is danger. Is danger... beautiful?"
     
       "The air is part of me. So are the flowers and the rocks. Neeko is everywhere."

       "Sharing memories, colors, feelings is magic! Magic connects people."
     
       "How can anybody miss home? Home is all around."
     
       "Neeko is on her fourth tail!"
     
       "Survival means blending in."
     
       "The spirits are all around me. Warm, like hugs!"
     
       "Neeko does not want to be here when... the others arrive."
     
       "This is very exciting! Everything is falling down!"
     
       "Do not be bound to a single body. There are so many more."
     
       "No, tail! We must be angry now."
     
       "People with no tails! Are they lonely? Yes."
     
       "After fight ends, everyone invited to picnic! Even enemies."
     
       "If Neeko knows your sho'ma, Neeko knows you."
     
       "What to do now? Find cheesebreads? Ooh! Have picnic!"
     
       "The Oovi-Kats are gone. Neeko is her own tribe now."
     
       "Neeko might have a thing for birds. And bird people."
     
       "We are to fight now? Let's go!"
     
       "If Neeko becomes Neeko, what does she look like?"
     
       "Beauty shines from inside, where the heart dances."
     
       "Neeko keeps a tiny bit of everybody's Sho'ma. They are precious!"

Moving in disguise disguise

     
       "Where is Neeko? I saw Neeko by the river. Everyone knows Neeko likes rivers!"
     
       "Is Neeko far? Is Neeko near? No one knows..."
     
       "If Neeko can be everyone, how can Neeko be sure she's anyone?"
     
       Neeko whistles. "I am definitely not Neeko. Nope. Not Neeko."
     
       "It's fun to walk around in different skins." Neeko laughs.
     
       "I am normal! Everything's normal. Nothing is suspicious."
     
       "Dee dee dee... Just minding my own business, not being Neeko."
     
       "I am being me and doing... me things. Not suspicious."
     
       "No one suspects Neeko to not be Neeko and to be not Neeko instead."
     
       "Neeko must stay unseen... until the last moment."
     
       "Be cool. No one suspects you are Neeko."
