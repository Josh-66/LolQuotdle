Movement
First Move

     
       "I sing to help them find themselves. The stage just makes it easier."
     
       "Everything sings to me! I've gotta sing it all back."
     
       "It can't be as simple as us versus them. I know if I sing loud enough, they'll listen!"
     
       "Wow. All these songs sound amazing. I'll bring them into harmony!"
     
       "When I'm on stage, I feel complete. I wanna help everyone find that peace."
     
       "Hello, world! I'm Seraphine, and you are beautiful!"
     
       "Everyone's singing the same song and they don't even know it!"

Moving

     
       "Come for the show, stay for the message."
     
       "Music helps you keep your head up."
     
       "Folks only love a reflection when it isn't theirs."
     
       "I wonder what I sound like outside my head."
     
       "People don't always listen, but that's no reason to keep quiet."
     
       "Joy's too quiet without sorrow on the downbeat."
     
       "Even in my dreams I hear them sing."
     
       "It's harder to stumble on this stage, but it sure does hurt more."
     
       "Couldn't lose the rhythm if I tried!"
     
       "Hope I don't get lost in all this music!"
     
       "Lookin' for a song in everything I meet!"
     
       "Haven't heard a soul that wasn't at least a little raw."
     
       "Follow my voice!"
     
       "Easier to hear someone else than to hear yourself."
     
       "Stage fright? Never heard of it."
     
       "You can't keep your song inside."
     
       "Everyone's got their own muse. Mine's...everyone."
     
       "Everyone fights to be heard. I'll fight to listen."
     
       "Not sure where I'm going. Can't wait to find out!"
     
       "Gotta keep moving with the music!"
     
       "Nothing better than a good song!"
     
       "Maybe the world's not ready for me. I don't mind waiting!"
     
       "Making it up as I go!" Seraphine sings.
     
       "Hear the world in my voice!"
     
       "Don't mistake me for my lyrics."
     
       "Gotta find the rhythm in the chaos."

Long Move

     
       "Some songs start with a rhyme, some with a rhythm... Mine starts with the crowd."
     
       "We fight for our lives every day. Every one of us."
     
       "We get as close to death as we can to feel alive."
     
       "We're all looking for meaning, even after we've found it."
     
       "Cities have songs too. Zaun and Piltover sing together in a dazzling duet."
     
       "Even if I heard every song, it would never be enough."
     
       "Breathe with your belly, breathe with your belly... Gah! Breathing is hard."
     
       "Moods are like melodies. They go up, they go down, and sometimes, they surprise!"
     
       "One day, the music will stop. Better dance while you can!"
     
       "I have this feeling like I'm yearning for something I've lost. One day, I'll catch it in a song."
     
       "For the longest time, I couldn't hear myself over the crowd. So, I made them part of me!"
     
       "Pilties say a new idea is just seven old ones all mixed up. That's kinda how my songs work."
