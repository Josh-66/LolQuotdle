      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Was the battle of Fallgren when I first took the rank of Sergeant General Colonel. Least, I think that's what rank they was. Gotta' remember to ask before killing them."

      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "First, we kill 'em, then we make 'em tell us where they came from."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Remember when we sacked Trevale, and that general thought we'd be willing to share the spoils? Pheh! Officers die just as easy as anybody."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "There ain't no land that ain't mine. Just land I ain't got around to claiming."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Just 'cause they're our team don't mean we can trust 'em."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "They're all trespassers, we're just killing them five first."

              Kled MarauderCircle.png "Fine, you said!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Yeah, reminds me of the siege of Ruug. Lot of men died on its high walls. It was fun."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "At the gates of Qualthala, they tried using that boiling oil on us, but you can't deep-fry courage!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I am deep-fried courage, and an apple pie of angry!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I know, I know."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Would you stop bitching for one minute?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Because I know someone is trying to sneak up on us!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Yeah, they think they so clever! Brains don't win fights, brains is what splatter on you!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Well, you the only thing I trust."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Yeah, well, that's what I thought."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Shut your hole, you dumb lizard."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Well, just 'cause you're a hallucination and I don't speak lizard don't mean I can't understand you!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "You do come up with the best ideas."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "No, it's when I don't drink mushroom juice that I have a problem!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I am Kled! High Major Commodore of the First Legion Third Multiplication Double Admiral Artillery Vanguard Company! You will respect my authority!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "We was having a nice conversation, then they showed up... uninvited!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Noxus was created to train the faithful."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "What are you whining about? I already fed you half a platoon!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Don't you bite me again!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Naw, it's just like the assault on Glorft. You seen one artillery vanguard in a commando fleet action, you seen 'em all."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Noxus ends where I say it ends."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Ain't much I love. Only this big sky, and this dumb lizard."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Let's get some new property."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "The sky is my roof, the open plains are my bed, and this lizard is the only company I need."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "This big sky, this green land. Now how could I share this with anyone?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Woo, it's darn pretty round here. Glad it's mine."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "You can't be lonely when the land is this beautiful."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Of course I want to pick a fight with 'em."

      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Yes, a sane man would run, but I ain't the running kind!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "No-one tells me what to do."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "This here land is mine!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "This is just a victory waiting to happen!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "This desert sky's gonna' open up with a rain of heavenly bloodshed and glorious violence!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I am the brutal instrument of my own destiny!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Ain't nobody gonna' give you nothing. Gotta' take it yourself."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Impossible ain't a Noxian word."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I didn't become a Rear Forward Brigadier Admiral from running!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I don't need that lizard! Kled's got his own ideas."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I don't need nothing but this axe... and this gun... and this hat."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Why's all these intruders so far away?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I know that lizard ain't talking, but I still hear him. Shut up, lizard. Shut up!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Stop talking, you stupid brain badgers!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Hey, what was that? Of course I don't need Skaarl... but he helps."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "What was that? Run straight into the tower?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I don't need a team to start a teamfight!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Sure! I'll kill all of them myself!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I don't need you Skaarl!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I said I wasn't not backing off, no how!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Even if I lose, I win! Just means I get to come back and kill you later!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I know you're listening, brain weasels! I ain't falling for it!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I am Sir Admiral Major Kled, and I smell a victory potpourri!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "First thing you learn as a Lieutenant Sergeant Commodore: rely only on yourself."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Skaarl! Come back, buddy! Skaarl?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Damnit, Skaarl! I hate walking!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I didn't not earn the rank of Sergeant double Admiral by not running!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Folks say I got violent tendencies." Kled laughs.
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Oh, she'll see, she'll see! She'll come strolling back when I turn them interlopers into a purée."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Ain't nobody tough as Kled! I've got gravel in my guts and a fire in my head!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I came here to... well, I don't know what I came here for, but I'm gonna' defend it!"

      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "You do realise... you're on my property?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "I figure I'll help you kill 'em... before I kill you."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Usually I find conversation boring and useless. You remind me I'm right."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "You feel like arguing about something? It'll make what happens later easier for you."
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "So... when exactly you planning on getting the hell outta' here?"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Woo, no sir, I ain't gonna' kill you and feed you to my lizard! Them's just... malicious rumours!"
     
      Kled OriginalCircle.png  
      Kled MarauderCircle.png "Oh, before I forget, what, uh... rank are you, exactly?"
