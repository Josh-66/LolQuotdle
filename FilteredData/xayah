            Rakan: "We have a plan?"
                Xayah: "We always have a plan."

       Xayah: "If things go wrong---"
        Rakan: "They always go wrong."
            Xayah: "They don't always go wrong."
                Rakan: "Mostly?"

       Rakan: "So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
        Xayah: "Are you pretending to be dumb?"
            Rakan: "Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
     
       Rakan: "When are we going to do this?"
        Xayah: "Soon, baby. Slow down."

       "Ionians never learn."
     
       "Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases."
     
       "I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand... "

       Rakan: "Thanks."
        Xayah: "For what?"
            Rakan: "Not saying 'I told you so.'"

        Xayah: "Not now!"
            Rakan: "Love is so cruel!"
     
       Rakan: "What's after this?"

       Xayah: "I think scars are sexy."
        Rakan: "Okay. I'll get more."
     
       Xayah: "Where do we go?"
        Rakan: "Wherever our hearts desire."

       Xayah: "Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
        Rakan: "Every day of my life."
     
       Xayah: "I'm lucky to have you."
        Rakan: "No. I'm the lucky one."

                Rakan: "No, I'm not! ... only a little."
     
       Rakan: "You are stunning and beautiful... "
        Xayah: "Why, thank you, darling."
            Rakan: "Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
     
       Xayah: "I need you to be more careful."
        Rakan: "If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a terrible color on me."
