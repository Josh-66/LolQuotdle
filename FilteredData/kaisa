       "This suit lives on me, it calls me home. We survive together."
     
        
       "You know that feeling when your skin crawls? Like a thousand needles poking through every pore? Blood pounding through every vein? That's just an itch compared to what lives on me."
     
        
       "The first time I returned from the Void, it was to save me. Now it's to save them."

       "I like it here, I just might stay."
     
        
       "This skin lives on me, and hunts with me."
     
        
       "Feed the beast... or be its meal."
     
        
       "I was spared for a reason."

       "A moving target lives longer."
     
        
       "I can make a difference here."
     
        
       "I will make a difference here."
     
        
       "This place is beautiful, I'm going to save it."
     
        
       "This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct."
     
        
       "It's a good day for a hunt."
     
        
       "I came back for the others who could not."
     
        
       "Hold our ground, attack them in theirs."
     
        
       "Void rule number one, don't die."
     
        
       "Exploit their mistakes."
     
        
       "Survival means never stopping, the Void knows that too."
     
        
       "This suit hunts in the manner I choose."
     
        
       "It's fight or flight, only now I do not run."
     
        
       "Stay alert, stay aggressive."
     
        
       "This world is changing... we decide into what."
     
        
       "Monsters are everywhere."
     
        
       "Ah, trees... How I missed them."
     
        
       "Danger is real, fear is an illusion."
     
        
       "Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there."
     
        
       "The skin grows restless... it needs to feed. If it doesn't, could I be next?"
     
        
       "Anger is useless to me, a wound that will only continue to fester."
     
        
       "I am the antidote, for the rivers of poison flowing beneath us all."
     
        
       "I kill so they don't die!"
     
        
       "I am not afraid!"
     
        
       "I'll be your monster!"
     
        
       "Power, not hate."
     
        
       "Hit and move!"
     
        
       "I survived the Void, but here is where my story has its best ending."
     
        
       "Get up, stand firm, strike hard."
     
        
       "I won't back down!"
     
        
       "The Void will not consume me, but I must act or the others will not be as lucky."
     
        
       "The hunt is on!"
     
        
       "I can make a difference here."
     
        
       "Strike hard!"
     
        
       "Just for you!"
     
        
       "You're nothing."
     
        
       "One mistake is all it takes."
     
        
       "When I was a child I was frightened of what lurked in the dark. How silly I was. Now, I call it home."
     
        
       "This is why I came back!"
     
        
       "Tell yourself you will live. Believe it, Kai'Sa, and you will have a chance."
     
        
       "Love... fear... whatever it's called, it's survival that motivates everyone."
     
        
       "I can rid them of these monsters, but who will save them from themselves?"
     
        
       "Let go of the anger. It does not serve."
     
        
       "Fear the Void's sting!"
     
        
       "Come on, come on."
     
        
       "This is why I survived!"
     
        
       "Thick skin always wins!"
     
        
       "I'm back!"
     
        
       "This place is too beautiful to be decimated by the Void."
     
        
       "My turn!"
     
        
       "Back in your hole!"
     
        
       "Only a child, and no one came to save me."
     
        
       "I won't quit!"
     
        
       "Ahh, a cold breeze. I remember these. Reminds me of home."
     
        
       "Maybe someday they will come to accept me. For now, they will need me."
     
        
       "The Void consumes everything, leaving only emptiness in its wake."
     
        
       "My skin is crawling... the needles... the itch... time to hunt."
     
        
       "Fear me!"
     
        
       "It's fight or flight, only now I do not run."
     
        
       "This skin taught me how to survive. I will show it how to live."
     
        
       "Look closely, and your prey will show you how to kill it."
     
        
       "The monsters are coming. We'll be ready. I'll make sure of it."
     
        
       "Survival is an instinct we all have."
     
        
       "I'll be back for more."
     
        
       "You're the hunted."
     
        
       "I wield the abyss!"

      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Tertiary directive: peaches."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "The hunt is binary, kill or be killed."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "The hunting ground has changed... but the hunt is the same."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Like magnets, we are drawn to each other to do battle."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Just the beginning."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "So this is what was before technology won? M'okay."

      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "I'm right here!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "This second skin gave me a second life. I will not take it for granted."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Metal on metal. Let's get loud!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "You're the prey!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Oh, how I like a fair fight."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "You realize we should be on the same side?"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "I survived the Void. I refuse to let death in. I refuse to accept it as my fate."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "They need to listen to me. Then they would see that I can show them a better way."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Attack!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "My carbon fiber exoskeleton is invulnerable to micro-meteorites, re-entry, and the vacuum of space. It has but one flaw: it can be a tad itchy."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Come on, let's go!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Human or machine? Make up your mind."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Some recoil at the sight of me. Underneath the shell, would they see I'm just like them."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Kill!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Fire!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "My suit AI will continue to learn with every kill... but it still could use a little extra battery life."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Hextech is a dead technology."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Fight hard. You are a living weapon."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Deploy!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Technology doesn't evolve; it upgrades."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "This skin is fashioned for survival, and honed by instinct."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Life and death are separated by the smallest stumble."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Engage!"
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "They have found me here. Let's settle this."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Time for an upgrade, rusty."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Wow, time for an upgrade."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "Time to pit steel against steel."
     
        
      Kai'Sa BulletAngelCircle.png "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, attack ships on fire on the shoulders of Or - ...Are those peaches?"
