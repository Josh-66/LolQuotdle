       "42... there's just something about that number."
     
       "I do love a good conundrum."
     
       "Every problem solved is another revealed."
     
       "One step closer to greater understanding!"
     
       "Fascinating, isn't it?"
     
       "Not enough variables... hmm... not nearly enough variables."
     
       "Order, entropy; a never ending cycle. Or is it?"

       "Your hexplosives are disturbing my research."
     
       "Would you mind taking your hexplosives elsewhere?"

Joke

     
       "Why do chemists call helium, curium, and barium 'the medical elements'? Because, if you can't 'helium' or 'curium', you 'barium'! Hm hm!"
     
       "Why do people say 'you can't trust atoms'? Because they 'make up everything'! Hehe!"
     
       "There are three key ingredients to invention: excessive imagination, good old fashioned stick-to-it-iveness, and a rocking good hairstyle!"
