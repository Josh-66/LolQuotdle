       "So close to a breakthrough. All I must do is connect the dots."
     
       "Every case, every investigation brings me one step closer to justice."

       "My duty is to protect the citizens of Piltover, and I will see that through."
     
       "I ought to thank 'C' for setting me on this path. Life in prison seems a proper gift, does it not?"
     
       "It should be progress, not power and fear, that leads Piltover into the future."
     
       "I'm placing my trust in you lot. Let's see this case through... and try not to disappoint me."

       "I much prefer this to desk duty."
     
       "Never a dull moment."
     
       "It's my business to know what others do not."
     
       "I'm not here to serve. I'm here to protect."
     
       "Let's investigate."
     
       "I must always be three steps ahead."
     
       "I cannot afford to falter."
     
       "The law bends for no one."

       "Me, miss? Not by a long shot."
     
       "I'm on the job."
     
       "Even the smallest clue can break a case."
     
       "A true professional is always aware of her surroundings."
     
       "I do love a good mystery."
     
       "Someone call for a sheriff?"

       "One must never start an investigation without first examining the evidence."
     
       "I always aim to win. And my aim is perfect."
     
       "They cannot run from the long arm of the law... nor from the scope of my rifle."
     
       "I am not Piltover's dog. I work for its people, no one else."
     
       "No matter the situation, a good investigator always remains calm."
