       "Alright! Which one of you's got great aim, and is good at chin scritches?"
     
       "Cats make great companions! Just ask my master... who disappeared under mysterious circumstances."
     
       "Who's ready to risk our lives, defeat our foes, and maybe knock over some cups?"
     
       "Tell me the game plan again. Wait. Fish! Someone has fish! Where is it?"
     
       "So, who wants to be my best friend? ...Book, I know you're already my best friend!"

Moving

     
       "Keep an eye out for red dot, Book! It's gotta be here somewhere."
     
       "Where's my fishy fishy fish for my dishy dishy dish?"
     
       (Yuumi sings.) "Where's my fishy fish fish dish? Meow!"
     
       "I won't lose you, Book! Not after losing Master."
     
       "Today we are destroyers!" Yuumi giggles.
     
       "Don't tell anyone but... I love hugs."
     
       "Book, float us that-a-way!"
     
       "Where to, Book?" Yuumi purrs.

       "Faster! Faster!"
     
       Yuumi yawns. "Is it time to save our friends again?"
     
       "Ooh, you smell good! Did you recently fish?"
     
       "Mush, mush! Wheeeeheehee!"
     
       "I could tell you wanted a brave and powerful warrior by your side."
     
       "Do you ever get so sleepy you fall asleep sitting up? Just me?"
     
       "Okay, it's time to prowl! You do know how to prowl, right?"
     
       "Rubbing my head on you means you're mine!" Yuumi purrs.
     
       "If we find a rat, I call dibs! Or a bug. Or a FISH!"
     
       "Wherever you go, I go! Just... don't go somewhere bad."

Long Move

     
       "Naps make my magic stronger! It's true! Look!" Yuumi snores and pretends to sleeptalk. "I'm so strong, mmh, so strong!"
     
       "Hey Book, do you ever take a nap? ...You can't?! What do you do all day?!"
     
       "Book, sometimes I pretend you're just a nice comfy box! ...What? That's a compliment!" Yuumi purrs.
     
       "The Book-keeper is a great role for someone as responsible as me! ...What?"
     
       "I save my friends? No one notices. I open a teensy portal to the spirit realm? Everyone is up in my fur!"
     
       "If I didn't have to protect Book, I'd just be a normal magical cat floating around Bandle City! Okay, napping around Bandle City."
     
       "I've read all of Book. Well, most of Book. I like the pictures of fish... of which there are none, Book!" Yuumi meows disapprovingly.
     
       "Ah, I miss the way my yordle scratched between my ears. ...Being read from cover to cover sounds nice too."
     
       "Hmm, today should I follow my head? Or my nose, or.. OH! Sunbeam ahead! Let's chase that!"
     
       "Someone scratched out the page that led here! That's right, Book. Someone! We'll never know who."
     
       "If I ever lost you, Book, the fabric of the spirit realm would get all torn up! And I'd lose my best friend."
     
       "I'm descended from lions! And you're descended from trees! We're in our element, Book!"

       "I am the brains, you are the brawn, Book... is Book!"
     
       "In case you're wondering what that smell is, it's Book. Smells like old trees."
     
       "Don't worry, I'll be here through thick or thin! Unless I smell fish. Gasp- Do you have fish?!"
     
       "Hey, new friend? Uh, warn me if you're going to do something crazy, okay?"
     
       "Don't get too attached, Book! This one looks reckless..."
     
       "Hey. Hey. Hey. HEY! ...Huh? Oh no, I don't need anything!"
     
       "You hungry? I stuck a leftover rat on page 237! Mew!"
     
       "Do you know what "vexatious" means? Book called me that and I think it might be mean."
     
       "If someone told you to jump in a lake, would you do it? Just 'cause... I go where you go."
     
       "I bet we'll be friends forever! Well, unless you wander into the brush with your face."
