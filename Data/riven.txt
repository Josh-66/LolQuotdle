Trivia

Original Riven Original Riven

    "A broken blade is more than enough for the likes of you!" might be referencing Ichigo Kurosaki from Bleach ("A dull blade is more than enough for the likes of you!").
    Riven and Xerath Xerath share the quote "Sacrifices must be made" (her voice faintly echoes while Blade of the Exile Blade of the Exile is active).

Dawnbringer Riven Dawnbringer Riven

    Some of her interactions to her counterpart skin, Nightbringer Yasuo Nightbringer Yasuo, have references to two poems written by the British poet George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron).
        Her kill quotes towards Nightbringer Yasuo Nightbringer Yasuo, "They know not I knew thee, who knew thee too well." and "Colder thy kiss.", as well as her taunt to him, "How should I greet thee?" "How should I greet thee?"--"With silence and tears." "With silence and tears." are from the poem When We Two Parted by Lord Byron.
        Her taunt with Nightbringer Yasuo Nightbringer Yasuo, "The sword outweighs the sheath." "The sword outweighs the sheath."--"And the soul wears out the breast." "And the soul wears out the breast." is from another poem by Lord Byron entitled So We'll Go No More A Roving.
