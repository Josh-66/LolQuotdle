Trivia

    Annie's jokes may be based on Ralph Wiggum's nonsensical manner of speech from The Simpsons.
     
       "What's your favorite animal? A bear?" has her audibly and purposely mispronouncing 'animal'.
        Following his rework, Dr. Mundo Dr. Mundo makes the same intentional mispronunciation in one of his lines:  
           "You in luck, aminal. Me also aminal doctor."
     
       "I'm rubber and you're... on fire!" references the first line of the popular children's rhyme 'I'm rubber, you're glue'.
     
       "Let's count to five!" references her passive Pyromania Pyromania: after using four abilities, the fifth use will Stun icon.png stun a target.
     
       "Eeny, meeny, miny, burn!" references the children's counting rhyme 'Eeny, meeny, miny, moe'.
        In the Latin American localization, it was changed to "¿Onta bebé?, aquí está. Fuego." ("Where's the baby? There he is. Fire.") referencing Diego from Ice Age.
            In V3.10, it was changed yet again to "De tin marín de do, te quemé." ('De tin marín de do, I burned you') referencing the children's counting rhyme De tin marín de do pingüe...
     
       "Ashes, ashes, they all fall down" references the American version of the nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses.
        In the Latin American localization, V3.10 changed it to "Sol, solecito, quémense un poquito." ("Sun, sun, burn you a little bit.") partially referencing a children's song.
    Annie shares quotes with:

          Ezreal OriginalCircle old.png  
          Thresh OriginalCircle.png "This way."
     
       "Beaten by a little girl... ha!" may be referencing Dracula's statement when defeated by 12-year-old Maria in Castlevania: Rondo of Blood.
     
       "Come out, come out, wherever you are!" references The Wizard of Oz.
