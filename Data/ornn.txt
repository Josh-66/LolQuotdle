       "All I need is myself, and... Hammer."

Movement
First Move

     
       "The best meal is a herd of cattle, with dark beer, and cherries... Mmm."
     
       "I'm going this way. Do not follow me. Please."
     
       "I made this hammer. It was so good I named it... Hammer."
     
       "I will go over there. It looks quiet. It will be nice."
     
       "Name's Ornn. No further pleasantries needed."
     
       "I have fur. It is soft. Do not hug me."
     
       "The Freljord is a place for building, fighting, and eating. Home sweet home."
     
       "If all goes well, our paths will never cross again. It never goes well."

First Move with Volibear Volibear

     
       (Ornn sniffs.) "Singed fur... Jealous blood... My brother is near!"
     
       "Volibear is near... Everyone seek shelter!"
     
       "I cannot choose my brother, only the weapons to slay my brother."

Moving

     
       "It is childish to favor one tool over another, but Hammer is my favorite."
     
       "Humans have done some things right: beer, dark beer."
     
       "Once a human kneels, they rarely stand again."
     
       "My forge is my home."
     
       "I do not need company; only a wall, to keep out company."
     
       "Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree. That was a weird century."
     
       "Bah, look at all these lazy trees."
     
       "Backbreaking labor is life's greatest pleasure."
     
       "The other gods don't understand me. Hmph, good."
     
       "The last time I ate a plant was never."
     
       "My work speaks in the roar of flame and the ringing of steel."
     
       "I will make an axe that is also a sword. And possibly a spoon."
     
       "Everything is better when it is molten. Lead, iron, chocolate cake."
     
       "I had followers once. They tried."
     
       "Luck is failure that failed."
     
       "I enjoy being alone. Fewer unintended casualties."
     
       "The Freljord forges men out of... whatever children are. Dirt, goblins."
     
       "Ornn builds things, go see Ornn. Nobody ever says thank you."
     
       "This world has potential. Needs hammering."
     
       "Gods do not need followers. Followers need gods."
     
       "Solitude always meets my expectations."
