Trivia

Original Brand Original Brand

     
       "Some say the world will end in fire." might be referencing Fire and Ice by Robert Frost but most likely Ragnarök (the Norse version of the end of the world where the earth is set on fire).
     
       "Is it hot in here or is it just me?" was part of Anivia's Anivia's old voiceover.
         
          Lissandra OriginalCircle.png "Is it cold in here or is it just me?" might be alluding to Brand's joke, considering Lissandra has a special taunt for him.

       "Every day I'm shambling." references both Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO ("Every day I'm shuffling") and Everyday I'm Hustlin' by Rick Ross.
     
       "Not easy being green... and dead." references Bein' Green by Kermit the Frog from The Muppet Show.
