First Move

     
       "My fellow travelers, you are all about to witness my majestic epicness! ... unless I get killed, but... probably not!"
     
       "Okay, everybody, I'm here, I'm here... the party starts now!"
     
       "Magic is in the heart. Magic is in the rhythm."
     
       "You see this cape? Ha! I say goddamn I'm sexy!"
     
       "I can't wait to get in there. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I am going to get in there!"
     
       "Xayah? Xayah? Crap. What was I supposed to do?"
     
       "Nothing important should be taken seriously."
     
       "War is in the dance."
     
       "Consequences only matter if I don't get away."
     
       "We are seen dancing and thought insane - by those who can't hear the music."

First Move with Xayah Xayah

     
       Rakan: "Alright, let's go! This way or that way?"
        Xayah: "Stick to the plan."
            Rakan: "We have a plan?"
                Xayah: "We always have a plan."
                    Rakan: "Huh. Really?"
     
       Xayah: "Ugh, I hate everyone today."
        Rakan: "I know what'll make you feel better... "
            Xayah and Rakan: "Murdering everyone!"
     
       Rakan: "Hey, I have a plan."
        Xayah: "You... have a plan?"
            Rakan: "Yeah! I'll go on instinct!"
                Xayah: "That's the opposite of a plan."
     
       Rakan: "You sure about this?"
        Xayah: "It has to be done."
            Rakan: "Be safe."
                Xayah: "Like you can talk."
     
       Xayah: "If things go wrong---"
        Rakan: "They always go wrong."
            Xayah: "They don't always go wrong."
                Rakan: "Mostly?"
                    Xayah: "They mostly go wrong."
                        Rakan: "That's why I'm here."
     
       Rakan: "So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
        Xayah: "Are you pretending to be dumb?"
            Rakan: "Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
     
       Rakan: "When are we going to do this?"
        Xayah: "Soon, baby. Slow down."

Moving

     
       "Our magic is a fury. It is a song you cannot resist."
     
       "Should I be... running? Yeah, I should... probably be running."
     
       "I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music."
     
       "Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here."
     
       "I am only as wild as magic."
     
       "Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt. Ecstasy needs a little fear."
     
       "If you aren't a little frightened, you ain't alive."
     
       "They've never seen moves like mine."
     
       "Magic is a wilderness."
     
       "Humans made promises. More than I can remember. They kept none."
     
       "Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies."
     
       "Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain."
     
       "I dance because I'm free!"
     
       "The only way to understand magic is to plunge into it, move with it, dance and dance!"
     
       "I'm getting impatient."
     
       "Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!"
     
       "The humans call it battle. It's just a dance."
     
       "I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously! Rude!"
     
       "They will see my dance, then they will know magic's joy... and its fury."
     
       "Okay, Rakan, get 'em watching you, then you burn 'em up."
     
       "I look good, I feel good, let's kick some ass!"
     
       "I got my look right, I got my moves right... time to show it!"
     
       "They will remember my name!"
     
       "I'm gonna' live forever!"
     
       "I'm going to take all they got, then laugh as I throw it away."
     
       "I've been kicked around since I was born. It's alright! It's okay! I'm staying alive!"
     
       "They will see me. They will see my dance!"
     
       "I will walk in. I will dance. They will party."
     
       "Name one genius that ain't crazy."
     
       "Ha! I'm G to the D! Golden diamonds, boy! Woo!"
     
       "I'm just trying to live the moment."
     
       "I don't need anything - but the right now."
     
       Rakan sings.
     
       "Man, have you seen that forest over there?"
     
       "I got freedom, I got a lady, I got a cause I'd die for. That's who I am."
     
       "Don't leave nothing! Bring it all!"
     
       "Time to get it started!"
     
       "I don't need to understand the plan! I trust my love."
     
       "It's all filthy and dangerous - and that's why I love it!"
     
       "I miss Xayah."
     
       "Fun. I need some fun. Now."
     
       "Why is it taking so long to get back to the action?"
     
       "It's a revolution. And it's good times."
     
       "I'm offended by how little attention I was given."
     
       "Humans think that to believe in something, you have to be serious about it. That's their problem."
     
       "They ain't ready for what I'm bringing!"
     
       "Ain't nothing I say should be taken seriously! That's why it's the truth!"
     
       Rakan raps.
     
       "This looks like another dangerous situation. Thankfully, I can improvise."
     
       "They're gonna' try and test me? Haha!"
     
       "Danger is as fun as you let it be."
     
       "I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations."
     
       "I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?"
     
       "You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it."
     
       "I can't wait to see what I'm going to do."
     
       "There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see."
     
       "I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny."
     
       "Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second."
     
       "Magic isn't supposed to be safe."
     
       "They're scared of darkness, they're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from."
     
       "They ain't seen moves like mine."
     
       "It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party."
     
       "For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air."
     
       "Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly - but you too!"
     
       "Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse."
     
       "It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth."
     
       "Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna' heal them."
     
       "I don't want a world that's safe."
     
       "I don't want a war - but I want to be free."
     
       "What human's call magic, we call life."
     
       "I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone."
     
       "I can't die looking this good!"
     
       "I am a chronic line-stepper."
     
       "I dance because I'm free."
     
       "If Xayah says someone has to die, they die - and they deserved it."
     
       "Woo! I am so into this! What is this?"
     
       "If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party."
     
       "I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?"
     
       "I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!"
     
       "They think they can catch me."
     
       "I don't do safe."
     
       "The universe loves me."
     
       "They want us in cages. We refuse."
     
       "I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!"
     
       "I'm gonna' burn this place down, then help them build it back up - so I can burn it again!"
     
       "I dance so fine I kill."
     
       "Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves."
     
       "Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future."
     
       "When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story."
     
       "I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music."
     
       "The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song."
     
       "I will make them dance. I will make them hear."

Moving near an Ally Xayah Xayah

     
       Rakan: " Hey, Xayah."
        Xayah: "Yeah?"
            Rakan: "You sexy."
     
       Xayah: "Keep them distracted."
        Rakan: "That shouldn't be a problem."
     
       Rakan: "You okay?"
        Xayah: "I'm fine."
            Rakan: "You're pushing yourself too hard."
                Xayah: "It has to be done."
     
       Rakan: "Where are we going?"
        Xayah: "You forgot the plan."
            Rakan: "No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?"
     
       Xayah: "You remember the Aphae waterfall?"
        Rakan: "Yeah."
            Xayah: "I'd like to go there again."
                Rakan: "Well, try not to die then."
     
       Rakan: "Darling?"
        Xayah: "Yes?"
            Rakan: "Pay attention to me."
     
       Xayah: "What the hell were you thinking?"
        Rakan: "Back there?"
            Xayah: "Yes."
                Rakan: "I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking."
     
       Rakan: "How can humans not hear the magic?"
        Xayah: "They're too busy building things."
            Rakan: "Why?"
                Xayah: "Because... they're afraid."
     
       Rakan: "Thanks."
        Xayah: "For what?"
            Rakan: "Not saying 'I told you so.'"
     
       Xayah: "Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."
        Rakan: "What was?"
            Xayah: "Good answer."
     
       Rakan: "You going to marry me today?"
        Xayah: "Ask me again tomorrow."
            Rakan: "I always do."
     
       Rakan: "Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"
        Xayah: "Not now!"
            Rakan: "Love is so cruel!"
     
       Rakan: "What's after this?"
        Xayah: "Another road, another horizon."
            Rakan: "Hm. Good."
     
       Rakan: "It's gonna' be okay."
        Xayah: "We can do this."
            Rakan: "Hey, I know that."
     
       Rakan: "You know I love you."
        Xayah: "What we have is greater than some human word."
     
       Rakan: "Did you notice the sky?"
        Xayah: "It's lovely."
            Rakan: "Not as beautiful as you."
     
       Rakan: "I am R-r-r-akan!"
        Xayah: "Ugh, what's with the accent?"
            Rakan: "I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"
                Xayah: "No. No, I do not."
     
       Xayah: "If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"
        Rakan: "Hubba hubba."
            Xayah: "No, that's not whistling."
     
       Xayah: "If you don't want to do this... "
        Rakan: "No! I want to!"
            Xayah: "You're only here because of me."
                Rakan: "... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me."
     
       Rakan: "What are those things humans wear on their feet?"
        Xayah: "Shoes."
            Rakan: "I need shoes. Red ones. I need them so bad."
     
       Rakan: "Did I tell you I love you?"
        Xayah: "Yes... but say it anyway."
            Rakan: "I love you."
     
       Rakan: "Why do you never say yes?"
        Xayah: "'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask."
     
       Rakan: "Can we just stay here?"
        Xayah: "We must keep moving."
            Rakan: "Aw... "
     
       Rakan: "Xayah? I think we got a problem... "
        Xayah: "Think, or know?"
            Rakan: "I... know we got a problem?"
     
       Xayah: "I'm so tired... "
        Rakan: "You gotta rest, honey."
            Xayah: "Everyone is depending on me."
                Rakan: "Everyone can wait."
     
       Rakan: "What would you do if I died?"
        Xayah: "I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."
            Rakan: "Aw... that's sweet."
     
       Xayah: "I think scars are sexy."
        Rakan: "Okay. I'll get more."
     
       Xayah: "Where do we go?"
        Rakan: "Wherever our hearts desire."
     
       Rakan: "How do you like me today?"
        Xayah: "More than yesterday, less than tomorrow."
     
       Xayah: "Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
        Rakan: "Every day of my life."
     
       Xayah: "I'm lucky to have you."
        Rakan: "No. I'm the lucky one."
     
       Xayah: "I swear, you will be the death of me."
        Rakan: "I'm fine with that."
            Xayah: "Me too."
     
       Rakan asks something in Vastayan.
        Xayah replies in Vastayan.
            Xayah and Rakan laugh.
     
       Xayah: "If we get separated, I'll find you."
        Rakan: "We won't get separated."
            Xayah: "You're already wandering off."
                Rakan: "No, I'm not! ... only a little."
     
       Rakan: "You are stunning and beautiful... "
        Xayah: "Why, thank you, darling."
            Rakan: "Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
     
       Xayah: "I need you to be more careful."
        Rakan: "If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a terrible color on me."

Moving while an Ally Xayah Xayah is Distant

     
       Xayah: "Play it safe!"
        Rakan: "Baby, I don't do safe!"
     
       Xayah: "You okay?"
        Rakan: "Oh, this is all so intense!"
     
       Rakan: "You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"
        Xayah: "With what?"
            Rakan: "Just generally! I'm amazing!"
     
       Xayah: "Honey, what are you doing?"
        Rakan: "I can't die looking this good!"
     
       Rakan: "After this, how about we get some human food?"
        Xayah: "A nice dinner?"
            Rakan: "Chocolate!"
                Xayah: "That's not what---"
                    Rakan: "We're eating chocolate!"
     
       Xayah: "Do you remember the plan?"
        Rakan: "Nope, but let's do it!"
     
       Rakan: "I have a cunning plan."
        Xayah: "Really? What is it?"
            Rakan: "I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!"
     
       Rakan: "I think you intimidate human females."
        Xayah: "Yeah, so?"
            Rakan: "It's kinda hot!"
     
       Rakan: "Should I show them the dance?"
        Xayah: "Show them the dance."
     
       Rakan: "You thinking about me?"
        Xayah: "I'm a little busy!"
            Rakan: "That's very upsetting!"
     
       Xayah: "Baby, what did I tell you?"
        Rakan: "Try not to die?"
            Xayah: "Close enough."
     
       Rakan: "Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"
        Xayah: "Yeah, gross."
     
       Rakan: "Rakan has arrived!"
        Xayah: "I saw you. Everyone can see you."
            Rakan: "Yeah! That's what I like!"
     
       Rakan: "Can I start off?"
        Xayah: "You want to start it off?"
            Rakan: "Let's start it off!"
     
       Rakan: "I'm a humble entertainer!"
        Xayah: "Really, darling?"
            Rakan: "Yeah, I'm the best."
     
       Rakan: "Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"
        Xayah: "Now's not the time, darling."
            Rakan: "It's always the time!"
     
       Rakan: "Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."
        Xayah: "Hi."
     
       Rakan: "I'm handling it, dear."
        Xayah: "Are you?"
            Rakan: "I was, I--- I will."
     
       Rakan: "How long do we fight?"
        Xayah: "Until we are free. Until magic is free."
            Rakan: "Is that after lunch?"
     
       Xayah: "Do you remember our escape route?"
        Rakan: "Uh... yes?"
            Xayah: "I'll take that as a no."
     
       Rakan: "How will we know if the plan works?"
        Xayah: "We'll still be alive!"
     
       Xayah: "Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"
        Rakan: "I am not a piece of meat."
     
       Rakan: "Caw caw, caw caw!"
        Xayah: "You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"
            Rakan: "We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!"
     
       Xayah: "Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"
        Rakan: "No-one can control me!"
            Xayah: "That's right, babe."
     
       Xayah: "Look sharp, baby."
