"I'm on the case."
"Shall I turn in my badge and rifle as well?"
"So close to a breakthrough. All I must do is connect the dots."
"Every case, every investigation brings me one step closer to justice."
"It's easy to overlook the rust beneath the gilding, but I never miss a detail."
"My duty is to protect the citizens of Piltover, and I will see that through."
"I ought to thank 'C' for setting me on this path. Life in prison seems a proper gift, does it not?"
"It should be progress, not power and fear, that leads Piltover into the future."
"I'm placing my trust in you lot. Let's see this case through... and try not to disappoint me."
"I'll be keeping a close eye on you, Jinx. You've caused enough chaos as it is."
"I'm glad you'll have my back, Vi. Let's keep the chaos to a minimum, shall we?"
"I will not tolerate lawlessness."
"Let's do this by the book."
"Always maintain a proper chain of command."
"The heart of Piltover is its people."
"I much prefer this to desk duty."
"Never a dull moment."
"It's my business to know what others do not."
"I'm not here to serve. I'm here to protect."
"Let's investigate."
"I must always be three steps ahead."
"I cannot afford to falter."
"The law bends for no one."
"No stone left unturned."
"Crime is common, logic is rare."
"Let's crack this case wide open."
"Hot on the trail."
"I'll have this finished before tea time."
"I love a good chase."
"Me, miss? Not by a long shot."
"I'm on the job."
"Even the smallest clue can break a case."
"A true professional is always aware of her surroundings."
"I do love a good mystery."
"Someone call for a sheriff?"
"Laws mean nothing when they fail to protect the public."
"One must never start an investigation without first examining the evidence."
"I always aim to win. And my aim is perfect."
"They cannot run from the long arm of the law... nor from the scope of my rifle."
"I am not Piltover's dog. I work for its people, no one else."
"No matter the situation, a good investigator always remains calm."
"I have all the evidence I need."
"This can only end with you behind bars."
"I'll take you and your confession back to HQ."
"Anything you say can and will be used against you."
"I know you're hiding something, Camille. I just need to prove it."
"Our values aren't so different, Ekko. Neither are Piltover and Zaun..."
"There is more to life than chasing glory, Ezreal."
"Am I to be the test subject for your latest invention, Heimerdinger?"
"Jayce, is this really the way to create a better tomorrow?"
"Is there a point to this madness, Jinx, or is it just a channel for your pain?"
"(gasps) Seraphine! Would it be inappropriate to ask you for an autograph?"
"This time, Urgot, I'll send you straight to prison myself."
"I never thought I would stand opposite you again, Vi..."
"Progress is essential to survival. But not like this, Viktor."
"Well, this is certainly interesting. Zac, was it?"
"Oh, a Yordle. How cute."
"Think you're above the law? Think again."
"Admitting your guilt? How generous."
"Ready, aim... (gasps) Urgh! Why am I not surprised?"
"You have the right to remain silent. I advise you use it."
"You won't escape!"
"Got them in my sights."
"I aim to win."
"This is where you yield!"
"Do not move!"
"No hesitation!"
"Let's rack this up."
"Suspect engaged."
"Surrender now!"
"Target in sight."
"I'll make this quick."
"Predictable."
"Stay out of my way!"
"No more cat-and-mouse."
"Up for a showdown?"
"In position."
"You cannot outrun your crimes!"
"Drop your weapons!"
"Brilliant!"
"As expected."
"Boom! Headshot."
"Pay no attention to the trap."
"Fancy a treat?"
"Mind the trap."
"Right where I want you."
"Got you!"
"Going somewhere?"
"Freeze!"
"Think again."
"Excellent shot!"
"Not so close."
"In my sights."
"Target marked."
"Taking aim."
"Calibrating..."
"Steady..."
"I never miss."
"Immaculate!"
"Exemplary!"
"So, it has come to this."
"I would've preferred you in cuffs."
"On to the next case."
"Open and shut."
"By the book."
"Tea time's over."
"Such a waste."
"An easy collar."
"Guilty as charged."
"Camille, I will not stop until I have all the answers."
"I cannot change the past, Ekko. But together, we can create a better future."
"Now, Ezreal, I'll take these artifacts as evidence."
"I hope you achieved the results you wanted, Heimerdinger."
"Our future will be bright, Jayce. I promise you."
"Perhaps Piltover can rest easy without you, Jinx. But Vi..."
"I was so looking forward to your next concert, Seraphine."
"A cell would've suited you much better, Urgot!"
"I never wanted this, Vi..."
"This 'glorious evolution'... it will not be our fate, Viktor."
"There are easier ways to create a kinder world, Zac."
"One down."
"And so it begins."
"Ready to surrender yet?"
"Perfect practice, precise results."
"Well that's going to take a great deal of paperwork."
"Case closed."
"Perimeter secured."
"Hardly what I'd call a defense."
"Securing the perimeter."
"Let's move up."
"Cheers."
"Thank you."
"Much appreciated."
"If crime never sleeps, then I'd best put on another pot of tea."
"Do not disturb the crime scene until I return."
"Be good while I'm gone, won't you?"
"I cannot let them down..."
"Can't leave this unsolved..."
"Tell Vi that I..."
"I'm back on the case! And this time I will not fail."
"It seems I may have a new suspect..."
"I'll be adding that to the charges."
"The Sheriff's in town."
"I've got a cupcake cupcake for you, little Yordle."
"Sharp shooting, everyone."
"GG!"
