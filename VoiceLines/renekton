"As I live, all will die!"
"Chaos will follow."
"All will suffer as I have!"
"Make this hurt..."
"Shred their fragile bodies!"
"They will feel pain they've never imagined!"
"Massacre them!"
"Trapped in a box so long Xerath, they never should have let us out!"
"Xerath, we will give them what they deserve..."
"There is no retreat."
"Welcome the havoc."
"Destruction approaches."
"Lavish brutality."
"Chaos will follow."
"Who's next on the chopping block?"
"Nothing will stop me!"
"Nasus cannot escape me forever!"
"The slaughter will never end!"
"Come back when you've collected all the bits of yourself!"
"You should have done a better job locking me away, Nasus!"
"You are not my brother, traitor!"
"What? Do I have someone in my teeth?"
"I will spare no one!"
"I will gut you all!"
"I will tear the world asunder!"
"Now you will know agony!"
"Cut them down!"
"Embrace the jaws of death."
"I'll leave them in pieces!"
"Carnage."
"Bask in their blood!"
"Light meat, dark meat, it's all the same."
"No suffering is too great!"
"Oceans of blood!"
"I'll leave you all in pieces!"
"You will not escape me, Nasus!"
"GG!"
"One day, you will suffer!"
