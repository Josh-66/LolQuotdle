"Conflict feeds the Freljord."
"Gutless."
"I can taste our enemies' hunger for victory. Let them starve."
"The spirits at the heart of the Freljord have need of me. I answer their call."
"Hear me, spirits. I pray for struggle. I pray for growth."
"A bear's strength is its joy. Its joy is strength."
"I do not channel the demigods."
"Following instinct alone is no way to live."
"Bodies are not vessels. They are anchors."
"A stagnant Freljord is a dead Freljord."
"For many years I thought I was cursed. I still wonder."
"The Seal Sister blesses with water and salt."
"Twice I have loved, twice I have left."
"Great Seal Sister, guide my steps through treacherous waters."
"Peace is not balance here."
"I did not truly know the Freljord until I left it."
"I do not fight alone."
"My time in Ionia taught me control."
"I am of no tribe."
"I channel the spirits I feel closest to."
"Joy and strength both crackle through me."
"Demigods cannot be trusted with balance."
"This life is my burden, and my land's blessing."
"The Winter's Claw was never my home."

"Anger the phoenix, and feel its talons."
"The beasts I channel within me are not me, but they are mine."
"Wants and needs are not the same. Wants echo. Needs howl."
"Sejuani's boar, her True Ice, her people, her purpose… I will protect them all."
"Kalkia helped me find myself. Lee helped me claim myself. Both good lessons."
"My power deepened after a meal from that old woman. Almost feels like a Seal Sister tale!"
"The Winter's Claw remembers the beast I once was… what I nearly did…"
"Why, spirits? Why was I chosen? For this struggle, will there ever be rest?"
"War with the Avarosans will end. Then my time, my life, will be my own again."
"Years of training, and the needs of others still ring louder than my own!"
"I am not good with people."
"Greetings are a waste of time."
"Your hunger for battle is too weak to overcome me."
"We will both grow from this."
"I choose this fight."
"Our fight will keep the Freljord alive."
"You cannot stay above it all, great Frostbringer. If the Freljord dies, it won't rise again."
"The Freljord would die in your hands, Ashe, broken beyond repair."
"Thousands of spirits, screaming… silenced… warped! What are you?!"
"I have missed you, Lee. Let our spirits meld, let us spar."
"Ice Witch, you are a blight on the Freljord! I will be its cure."
"Weapons are often the tools of cowards, great forger."
"Sejuani, do not make me your enemy. Please!"

"I will put your gift to good use, protector."
"Abomination! I lay you to rest with no regret."
"This… thing has no spirit. It is empty."
"This cavern is not your home, dragon. Why defend it?"
"The spirits of dragons burn and roar long after they die."
"Alone, proud, feeling… hoppy?"
"Ribbit."
"This form… her prison."
"Let me help you, Rift Herald."
"Stone-bodied, but with a living heart inside."
"I… we… live and die together as unshakable stone."
"We smell blood on the air. A feast awaits!"
"Hunger, gnawing, wild, wolven!"
"I feel her need to protect the nest."
"Mother raptor, forgive my trespass."

"Challenge me!"
"Awaken, ram!"
"Blazing charge!"
"You cannot escape our inferno!"
"Phoenix spirit!"
"The storm rages through me!"
"Ice wind!"
"Storm follow!"
"Awaken, phoenix!"
"Save your tears!"
"Frost and fury, our perfect storm!"
"Balance is not always fair. I am… sorry."
"Your struggles are ended."
"Fallow Fox keep you."
"The circle continues, unbroken, unwavering."
"To take life… I do not do it lightly."
"A moment of silence."
"With your death, Ashe, the True Ice will not melt."
"My most worthy and most beloved opponent."
"Forgive me, Kalkia, I swore to protect your Sejuani, I…"
"I close my mind to you, great Valhir!"
"Thank you for refusing to strengthen my enemies!"
"No peace for the Freljord!"
"I venerate my kills. My enemies, they revel in theirs."
"A great beast has been felled… without proper rites."
"I see the world through the eyes of those I channel."
"Each stance flows into the next like water."
"Needs in the Freljord are loud. Meditations quiet my mind."
"The frost… is melting…"
"Silence… at last…"
"Urgh, even in death, silence is brief."
"Must refocus."
"Instinct led me one way. Training, another."
"Not yet, Fallow Fox."
"What technique do you use?"
"Your form is excellent!"
"GG!"
