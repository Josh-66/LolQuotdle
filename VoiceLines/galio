"Time to make an impact!"
"Back to sleep, then... "
"You know what's hard about fighting? Nothing! Come on, I'm made of stone."
"I've got a high tolerance for magic. Takes a lot for me to feel it."
"As a symbol of this great nation, I say... let's go mess up some mages!"
"Know of any battles? Just looking to get my wings dirty."
"People are funny. They pass beneath me doing the same thing day after day."
"I'd like to apologize in advance for ruining this place."
"Let someone else be a statue, I got stuff to do."
"I don't wake up 'til its time to squash something and I'm awake right now."
"Ahh, feels good to stretch my wings."
"I didn't choose to come to life, but I definitely prefer it."
"I've seen much, not sure I understand it but... it... it happened."
"Hahaha, majestic? Is that what I'm supposed to be?"
"I might be made of stone, but that doesn't mean my heart is."
"I wish mountains had fists - that'd be a good fight."
"Hmm, must be some powerful magic around here."
"Somehow I always end up in the center of everything."
"The guy that made me, he was pretty good right?"
"Tragedy is worse when you can do nothing about it."
"I wish they'd chisel me a friend. Someone who won't break!"
"I know, it's completely unfair. I didn't ask to be this impressive."
"I always wonder what lies beyond this land. Something to fight, I hope."
"I am not going back on the pedestal, not yet... "
"They made me to stop magic, and yet I hate when it's gone."
"I sleep, I wake, I break things"
"Whoa, I didn't know I had a tail!"
"Do I get to crush that? Oh, please say yes!"
"I don't know why life chose me, but I'm glad it did."
"I'm supposed to be a symbol. Of what, I'm not so sure."
"It's hard to be a symbol, when you've got a soul."
"Let's move! I've got people to inspire!"
"It's not easy when everyone looks up to you."
"Can someone please get the pigeons out of my head?"
"Ah, mages. I love the way they squish."
"I don't break easy."
"I fought a house once. I'm pretty sure I won."
"People vanish! And new ones take their places! It must be magic."
"The best defense is me."
"The best offense is a good magic absorbing colossus."
"I love walking, it sounds like thunder!"
"Ah, the world, it goes by in a flash."
"It's time to move! Shake off the moss."
"I'm going, you try moving three hundred tons."
"They just don't make doorways big enough."
"Going to sleep means saying goodbye."
"Which way's the fun?"
"What should I break next?"
"They say I'm all made of petricite, I say I'm all guts!"
"I fell in love with a crag-beast once. Oh... wasn't meant to be."
"I haven't been to many places, so I might as well like this one."
"Let me do the heavy lifting."
"Get behind me, huddled masses!"
"People live such tiny lives!"
"I'm a big man, with big needs."
"One people year is fifty Galio-years."
"I love Demacia! It's the only place I've been."
"At last a change of scenery!"
"Apparently I'm some sort of big deal."
"Who wants to get protected?"
"Excuse me, but... which king are we on now?"
"Greetings, giant glowing mineral! I must break you."
"Ooh, a giant crystal? I'll fight it."
"You're from space, huh? I'd fight space. Bring it on!"
"I've always wanted to fight the sun. Let's go, space man!"
"Hey, World Eater, I've got something you can snack on. It's my fist!"
"Dang right, Demacia!"
"Summon your god, painted priestess, and we'll see who's mightier."
"You're a Jarvan? I swear, I've met at least three others."
"You. Young girl person. Can you stay and accompany me wherever I go?"
"Hm. How strange. No-one bothered to sculpt you?"
"So, what's it like living underwater? Fought any whales?"
"I like you, small blue thing. You're the one who doesn't change."
"Back to your hole, giant crawly worm."
"Hahaha! Ours would be a fight for the ages! They'd find pieces of us for miles around!"
"You look horrid! I should give you the name of my sculptor."
"Do not raise your claws at me, furry growly man."
"Looks like I'll have to punch down. Hmph. Way down."
"I don't fight small things. Come back with something bigger and meaner."
"What awful material were you sculpted from?"
"I'm sorry, I just woke up. Were we fighting?"
"Hey, you. Don't mess with Demacia, I saw you thinking about it."
"Didn't I fight you yesterday, or was that a different puny thing?"
"Would you like to ride on my massive shoulder?"
"Quick! Hide in my crevices."
"Rest in my ample shade."
"You know, gargoyles and Yordles have a lot in common."
"Gargoyle? No, I'm more of a magic-nullifying colossus."
"Climb up here and say that my face."
"You speak a lot, loud talky thing."
"Hmph. Good thing I don't have ears."
"My middle name is Justice. Galio Justice Justice."
"I came to chew bubblegum and kick butt, and I'm all out of butt."
"You're going to need some mending."
"So... what do you people do when you're not fighting?"
"Bring it."
"Wanna go?"
"So many things to squash!"
"Not a fair fight."
"Go time!"
"Smash."
"Fight me, small warrior person!"
"Good thing I don't bleed."
"Magic goes in, might comes out."
"Crunch!"
"Hmhm, people break."
"I. EAT. MAGIC!"
"We don't have to fight. Let's do though!"
"Honor."
"Justice."
"Stone cold."
"Punching time!"
"Hahaha! This never gets old."
"To battle!"
"Yes!"
"It's punch o'clock!"
"Boom!"
"Well, hello there, handsome."
"At last, a worthy opponent."
"Well met, giant zapping man!"
"I got the big guy!"
"There is only room for one of us."
"What are you looking at?"
"Heh, stone on stone!"
"You're a sentinel? I'm a sentinel! We should fight!"
"It's like a weaker version of me."
"Let us make violence, fellow rock man!"
"My wings versus yours. Let's go!"
"Hello beautiful, what are you doing here?"
"Greetings fellow large thing, let's fight!"
"Now this will be a fight for the ages."
"Yes... now that's a fellow I can punch!"
"Wing blast!"
"My wings, your face!"
"Feel the whoosh!"
"Wing punch!"
"Feel the breeze!"
"Blow it down!"
"Flap!"
"Wind!"
"Whiff!"
"Both wings!"
"Goin' somewhere?"
"Don't have long, let's fight!"
"Haha, come here!"
"Let's get rowdy!"
"I can take it!"
"Pick on someone my size!"
"Fight me! Now!"
"Gotcha!"
"Step right up!"
"Take your shot!"
"I'll take you all on!"
"Come get some!"
"Let's do this, then!"
"Take the first swing!"
"Whammo!"
"Uppercut!"
"To the chin!"
"Better bite down!"
"Punch!"
"Aha!"
"Fist!"
"Crack!"
"Bustin' heads!"
"Up you go!"
"Lights out!"
"Haymaker!"
"Knuckle up!"
"Get your guard up!"
"To your face!"
"Freedom punch!"
"Hammer fist!"
"And back!"
"Big blast!"
"That's it!"
"Smash!"
"Right!"
"Hi, everybody!"
"Eww, dead guy in my toes."
"Too easy."
"Squish."
"Vanquished!"
"Like a bug."
"Splat."
"Next!"
"Oops! Friendly fire."
"Squish, squish, squish!"
"Ooh, that was glorious."
"Who's still standing?"
"Hahahaha, did we win yet?"
"Hehehe, I like buying person things."
"Hmm... doesn't come with instructions."
"I don't know what this is. I bet it's great though!"
"That builds INTO something."
"Haha! Tiny."
"Hmm... looks red."
"To plug my cracks."
"Can I exchange this for a size seven-thousand?"
"Hmm... it doesn't fit. Well, guess I'll just hold it."
"Armour, kinda makes you feel like you're made of stone."
"Cloth will protect my rock hard skin!"
"Eh, never been much of a reader."
"Smashing power amplified!"
"A book! Oh, just need someone to turn the pages for me."
"A paginated collection of words!"
"Glacial? Oh, that sounds big."
"From the frozen loom! Whatever that is."
"Protect me, tiny ice shield!"
"Haha, ice fist!"
"So cold, yet it makes me feel all warm inside."
"Unleash your power, magic frozen fist!"
"Punchy spikes!"
"Make me stronger, purple zapping stick!"
"Rod of Ages? Hm, sounds old."
"This is perfect! I too am very old."
"I'll use it as a toothpick!"
"Might need to loosen that a few hundred notches."
"Belt's a... little tight."
"Looks dangerous... let's fire it up!"
"I know, I'll wear it as a ring!"
"Oh, I hate to miss out on the action... "
"Everyone stay put, I'll be right back."
"Phew! I'm tired of punching."
"Time for some fresh mortar."
"Demacia calls."
"Need a break from clobbering."
"I... crumble... "
"Mend... me... "
"I am cracked... "
"How long was I out?"
"Ah, how'd I get back here?"
"Okay, new battle!"
"Well, we lost that one. Let's go fight something else!"
"What happened? Was it a frost troll again?"
"I am chiselled anew."
"Hey, I remember this place."
"An honor to face you!"
"Your success is well deserved."
"GG!"
