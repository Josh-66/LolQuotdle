"Quest accepted! ...Wait, where are we going?"
"Hey, your loss. But I get it."
"A New Horizon"
"Burning Bright"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. World. Peril. Save it. I got it, I got it."
"Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere…"
"Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory… girls are watching."
"I don't care where here is. Just point me toward adventure."
"To save video games, he had to become video games. Ezreal is… video games."
"Burning Bright! Nah-nah-nah-nah Nah-nah-nah-something."
"A New Horizon"
"Burning Bright."
"Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty."
"The gauntlet's for show… the talent's all me."
"Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me."
"I'm at my best when the world's on the brink of annihilation."
"Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something's impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it."
"I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it."
"Never met a problem I couldn't blast away with magic… that I don't even understand."
"True explorers follow the compass in their heart."
"If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?"
"I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good."
"I hate the word 'steal.' I prefer 'liberate' or 'procure.'"
"When you've got talent, there's not such thing as a lucky shot."
"Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those."
"Exploration runs in my family. It's in my blood."
"I'm always open to new ideas. My new ideas."
"Once it's a ruin, I can legally loot it."
"Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was… not pretty."
"I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet."
"They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice."
"Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a… jackal head, end of times… the usual. I just wanted this ruby scarab. It looked great on my mantle."
"Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great."
"It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do… *cough* not have a college degree."
"I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? ...Don't answer that."
"I use a fake name in Demacia: Jarro Lightfeather. Sentinel of Light, 8th Order. He's a national hero."
"I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself."
"No plan survives first contact with me."
"There's an unspoken law in archaeology: Finders, keepers."
"Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule."
"Who needs a map?"
"Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it."
"Ooh, did I save my game before this?"
"I'm rated E for Ezreal."
"What level am I on?"
"Ez tanks, locked and loaded."
"Uh, I hold the speed-running record for Hyper Crystal Dungeon. This is nothing."
"Woo! Just unlocked the 'Awesome at Everything' achievement!"
"Huh… where's the warp zone?"
"I'll beat this… League of Legends?"
"Star Guardians for life! Except during Ezreal time. Gotta have my Ezreal time."
"How 'bout a serenade?"
"Hmm, maybe I'll ask the First Star for a tuxedo… and some roses."
"I don't want to brag, but I'm somewhat of a cosmic sensation."
"Outshine everyone, and no one will see what you're up to."
"At least the First Star didn't put me in one of those sailor getups."
"The entire universe awaits us."
"If it's not made of stardust, it's not worth the effort."
"I can't believe they talked me into this."
"True Star Guardians never burn out."
"Gotta admit it, the uniform's growing on me."
"...And my boots are not waterproof. Fantastic."
"Ugh… water's cold. AHH! Something touched my foot!"
"'Know your environment.' My environment… is wet and muddy and probably filled with leeches."
"I always know a shortcut."
"This reminds me of discovering the spirit tomb of Ekrin."
"A beaten path is a boring path."
"No way to predict the twists and turns ahead. That's why I wing it!"
"Don't make me put my goggles on. They're decorative."
"Time to show 'em who's best. Spoiler: it's me."
"Yuuto says you're ugly. I agree."
"Oh, a little girl! There's gotta be a twist. *gasps* It's the teddy bear, isn't it?!"
"Hey, Ashe. I totally meant to return that Avarosan sculpture thingy. Is that an ice bow? That's a cool ice bow."
"A celestial dragon that throws stars. Well, this is totally normal. I can do this."
"Possession is 9/10ths of the law, Caitlyn. Those pre-Zaunite demon totems are mine fair and square."
"Okay, Camille. Fork over that Brackern Brackern Crystal."
"Woo! Strong goggles game, Corki. Keep it up."
"Aw, crap, I opened a mirror dimension again! ...Does my hair really look like that?"
"Giant petricite gargoyle. So it's gonna be one of those kind of days."
"Hey, brainface, you are why no one likes Yordle inventors."
"Can't manufacture magic in a lab, Jayce! Or good looks, for that matter."
"That mask is not art, Jhin. It's ancient history."
"Nope! I did not sign up for Jinx-level crazy."
"Hey, Lamb… is Wolf friendly?"
"Oh, I've heard of the Black Rose. Nasty reputation... I mean, uh, huge fan!"
"Lucian! It's me… Jarro Lightfeather."
"Don't pretend you didn't see me, Lux. That doesn't work."
"Hey, Lux! *clears throat* Hey, Lux. What're yah up to later? Let's hang."
"I'm a mage. You're a mage. I'm blond. You're blonde. Doesn't it feel like we're made for each other?"
"Hi, honey! Is it too soon to call you honey? It's too soon."
"Pink looks good on you, Lux. I like it."
"Your eyes really do twinkle like starlight."
"Can you forge me a matching gauntlet?"
"Well, you are just terrifying, aren't you, Pyke?"
"So… Rakan. How serious are you and Xayah? Just asking."
"What the heck is that?!"
"Hey, Ryze! Are you still hiding all those dangerous runes in one place? *louder* Should I not yell that?"
"Oh, c'mon! Sivir! I swear, I didn't know I was robbing your family's ossuary!"
"Throw some more rocks, Taliyah! I need targets to shoot!"
"Yeah, I get it. It's tough being handsome. Right, Taric?"
"Well hello, Xayah. You should know that I am pro-Vastayan rights."
"Hey, Xerath! How come you didn't get a cool Ascended animal body?"
"Gahh, I'm too young for you, Zoe. Cradle-robber."
"Zoe, you're ruining my chances with Lux!"
"Oh, cool. Great. They have an Ascended. This should be fun."
"Everyone! Watch your coin purses!"
"Darkin? We're gonna need a bigger army!"
"Listen, I have met exactly one Demacian I've liked. By the way, has Lux mentioned me at all? Just curious."
"Jarro Lightfeather doesn't do autographs. Sorry."
"Oh, okay, demigods! Well, universe, you seem to really want to screw with old Ezreal today!"
"Oh, please, we gotta deal with demigods?! I really need to up my rate."
"Demons? This is a job for Jarro Lightfeather."
"The uglier the monster, the more fun they are to shoot."
"Why is it always about strength with Noxians? How about vulnerability for once?"
"Noxians. I hate these guys."
"Heh! Piltovans! Always think they're the center of the universe."
"Targonians… Hey, ten words or less, what exactly are you guys?"
"Shadow Isles… all that Black Mist has got to be protecting something really valuable."
"Shurimans. Always thinking I appropriated their cultural heritage. They're not wrong."
"Didn't expect unliving ghouls. Note to self: always expect unliving ghouls."
"Vastaya! Just like in Santangelo's field guide!"
"Yordles. Why'd it have to be Yordles?"
"I'm better than the First Star. Don't tell Ahri Ahri I said that."
"Do I wear my gauntlet... or does my gauntlet wear me?"
"Hey there, gauntlet! How ya doin', buddy?"
"Call me when the stakes are higher."
"You belong in a museum!"
"Oh, please don't die. I can't lose a sidekick. Not again."
"Hey. We can do this! Well, I can do this. You, 50/50."
"Stick with me and you'll be fine. That's not a guarantee, by the way."
"Sick burn… probably? Wasn't listening."
"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What are your weak spots again?"
"There's somewhere else I gotta be. Literally anywhere else."
"Ah. Watch this. ...We will never speak of this again. Ever."
"This is no time for jokes. Your jokes. My jokes are great."
"Lot of good mages out there! None of them are this hot!"
"Are you not intrigued?"
"Time for a true display of skill."
"Gauntlet, let's clear a path."
"Watch and learn!"
"Blast 'em, gauntlet!"
"No time to waste!"
"Hah! I can blink and still not miss."
"Magic? Comin' at you."
"Obstacle, meet gauntlet."
"Pick a timestream, kid."
"Hey Garen! How's your sister?"
"Red. That's fitting for you, Jinx."
"This is flirty fighting."
"Heh, this is so us! Right, Lux?"
"So, are you busy later?"
"Aim for the legs…"
"Leave Lux alone, Zoe!"
"I'm gonna send you back to… wherever Yordles come from."
"Stand back! Let an expert handle this."
"Gawk at this!"
"Marvel at that!"
"Heha!"
"Get starstruck!"
"Embrace the cosmic light!"
"Light never dies!"
"Nice shot, me. High-five."
"Another day, another bullseye."
"I. Never. Miss. But I have been known to fire a warning shot or two…"
"Must've ricocheted off a cricket or… something…"
"Gauntlet! You're embarrassing me in front of the bad guys!"
"It wasn't a miss. It was a… near-hit."
"That was a, uh… that was a warning shot!"
"I blame the terrain. Totally that rock's fault."
"Yeah!"
"Over here!"
"Now I'm here!"
"Name's Ezreal. E-Z-… oh, you're dead."
"And Ezreal is victorious! Ahhh! Yeah!"
"That's what skill feels like. Hurts, doesn't it?"
"Oooh, that looked like it hurt."
"Maybe next time I'll open an eye."
"Can't learn that in a textbook."
"And now, you're cosmic dust!"
"No applause, please! ...Okay, maybe just a bit of thunderous acclaim! ...A little?"
"Good job, everyone. Let's, uh… just keep doing whatever you were doing."
"Wow. That escalated quickly!"
"Take five, everyone. I got this."
"Everyone see that? No? Damn! Now I've got to go and do it again!"
"Oooh, I hope that wasn't a world heritage site."
"They just don't make temple traps like they used to."
"I'll come back later and sift through the rubble for artifacts."
"Cool guys never look back at explosions."
"Never act like victory is assured. Even though it probably is."
"That belongs in a museum. ...All of this belongs in a museum... I won't say anything."
"If anyone asks, I didn't see any of these priceless artifacts for sale."
"Don't worry, I'm not the magic artifact police. Wait, are you?"
"Can I get an itemized receipt? My accountant's way too good at his job."
"Nice. You can send the bill to my uncle's museum."
"This is really worth ten times the asking price."
"We mages call this a warlock exit."
"Ancient. Magic. Words."
"Don't attempt anything glorious in my absence."
"Alright, guys. Don't miss me too much."
"Relax. I blindly teleport long distances all the time!"
"Whoa. Time out, everyone! Don't continue the fight without me!"
"A New Horizon"
"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."
"I'll be omitting that little mishap from the expedition logs."
"I truly hope nobody saw that."
"Back from the dead? That confirms it. I am a god."
"No problems here!"
"Haha, I'm allergic to caution."
"I'm a professional."
"You're between me and glory."
"I'm not even breaking a sweat."
"Hard work? Not today!"
"All part of the adventure."
"Sounds dangerous. I'm in."
"No luck. All skill."
"I'll handle this!"
"No sweat."
"Oh-ho! It is so on."
"I'll make this look easy."
"I'll show you skill!"
"Ready for the best?"
"GG"
"I let you guys off easy!"
