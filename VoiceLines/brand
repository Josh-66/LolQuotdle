"Ready to set the world on fire? Heheheh..."
"Going."
"Going."
"I'm on a short fuse."
"Like wildfire."
"Yes..."
"I will blaze a trail."
"You can't contain me, summoner."
"After millennia, I am free!"
"This body is just one of many!"
"I am the fire that cleanses the world!"
"Is that fireproof?"
"Is it hot in here or is it just me?!"
"The inferno begins."
"The fires of vengeance."
"I purify this one!"
"Forged in pain!"
"Their scars will be warning."
"Some say the world will end in fire."
"Burn! Hahaha!"
"Burn! Hahaha!"
"This world will be consumed in flames!"
"This is not the end..."
"GG!"
