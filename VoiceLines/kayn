"Will you prove worthy?"
"Probably not."
"The weak fear the shadows."
"Fear controls them."
"The child is gone. The killer will remain..."
"I will survive eternity; they will die today."
"The blood of the fallen will annoint me the new master."
"Everyone does look better in red."
"Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed."
"Killing is the plan. Let me show you..."
"The true assassin kills one to save many."
"Such noble lies. Save no one; it's so liberating!"
"Rage inside me will not be contained!"
"The spade does not dictate the architect's vision."
"Cast off the yoke of Zed's order."
"It is the order that will break you, Rhaast."
"There is fear in your grip and doubt in your heart."
"I have no heart—that you should fear."
"The undoing draws near."
"Yes—yours."
"I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy."
"I have chosen you. You will serve me."
"I have mastered every weapon of war. No prattling tool will prove an exception."
"Whom should I obey? Master Zed, or the farm implement with delusions of grandeur?"
"Underestimate me at your peril."
"Kill the body."
"Kill the mind."
"The rage is in your hands; let it loose!"
"Their screams thrill me."
"Zed's order shackles you; I offer freedom!"
"You are not worthy of the power you hold."
"This is the part I like best: the anticipation. No, it's the killing."
"Such an obsequious pupil. I will be your new master."
"Target the strong. I am a weapon, not some accessory."
"Neither time nor violence will end me."
"What does Rhaast mean anyway?"
"Obey."
"I learned from a young age to embrace the shadows."
"Darkness is a start."
"I let you go and you will die."
"And you will lose."
"I am the weapon; you are a tool."
"Lies soothe the mind, don't they?"
"What will be the final lesson?"
"Give in, and I will show you."
"I am no toy, Kayn."
"You possess the hubris of a more fearsome weapon."
"There is much darkness around you—in you."
"That is my armor."
"Tell me, was it desperation that led you to me?"
"Audacity."
"I see your nightmares. Do they trouble you?"
"Not nightmares—plans..."
"I have waited eons to bathe this realm in blood!"
"Talk, talk... You'll do nothing without me."
"Ionians... Are they all as confident as you?"
"There is no one like me."
"Wait by the river long enough and the enemy dead will float by."
"Oh, yeah... Let's turn this river red."
"Oh, how I miss the smell of blood in the water"
"Today you will be reminded."
"Their screams will echo in this place."
"Stain this fetid swamp with their blood."
"There are a thousand ways to kill you in this moment; I'm planning the right one..."
"This will be quick, but still painful."
"I was forged to destroy, and you are in my way."
"I will take that pitiful existence you call a life from you."
"Your kind go no further!"
"Your kind go no further!"
"Yordles... Uggghhh, you sicken me."
"Death and war. This will be delicious..."
"We find Aatrox, and it's a party. Of murder. A murder party!"
"Together, we are unstoppable, Zed!"
