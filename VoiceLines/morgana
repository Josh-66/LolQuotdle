"I am bound, but I will not break."
"Your worst decisions will haunt you."
"The trials I endured were seared into my soul, they drive me forward even after my wounds have healed."
"With each step I forge my fate in the fires of pain."
"True grace is beautiful in its imperfection, honest in its emotion, freed by its own frailty."

"They are not ready for the reflections within my darkness."
"Kayle, blinded by the shadows your light casts."
"I will not disappear, as much as Kayle would like me to."
"I shall battle my heartless twin once more."
"You demean yourself to fight amongst the mortals, Kayle."
"Kayle. I know her soul. She broke my heart."
"I am unmade in the image of my twin."
"Once I thought the air above was sweet. Now... I find it stifling."
"I prefer an honest sinner over the righteous liar."
"Nothing makes you feel alive like knowing you might die."
"I have seen liars choose virtue and I have seen the divine cheat. Perhaps today I will see a Yordle sneeze."

"This world is all I have."
"Righteousness. A splintered shield that I will shatter."
"I would cut off my wings if there were steel strong enough."
"Demacia forgot the true cost of war. I remember."
"Justice is a lie of the powerful. I have truths of my own."

"My shadow outruns my sister's light"
"We are shaped by our foes."
"Whether by chains or by wings, we are all bound."
"Hmm, battles bring out so many emotions."
"Only death can break my bonds. And I... am immortal."
"Not all light is a gift."
"I find beauty in these shadows."
"I know what my enemies feel. They are right to be afraid."
"I don't hide my pain, I wield it."
"Mistakes shape us."
"Remember strolling together in the woods, when we were girls?"
"Hmph. You never had any fear..."
"Funny, I remember it differently."
"Today, it seems we must put our animosity aside."
"We've never been enemies, sister."
"How beautiful your mind must be to think such things."
"How tragic yours to believe them."
"Do not turn your back on me, sister!"
"I never did."
"Do not run from your shadow, Kayle."
"I am the light!"
"Those who wear armor fear death, Garen. And that's a lot of armor."
"Those you love can destroy you, Jarvan."
"Do not run from your shadow, Kayle."
"Sister. You broke our family and my heart."
"Kayle, have you forgotten our father?"
"You mask your feelings, Kayle, because you have none."
"LeBlanc. Wish my twin would disappear as fast as yours."
"There is darkness in everyone, Lux. Even you."
"Your secrets are why you suffer, Lux."
"Your soul sings for a fallen world, Sona."
"I saw you in your cell, Sylas. Heard your cries. Felt your anguish."
"Darkness reveals our truth, Zed."
"Sister, here to break my heart anew?"
"Better a broken heart than a shackled soul shackled soul."
"At least I haven't smited all my friends."
"Your sword is with me. Do you want it back?"
"I need no blade."
"Why have we wings, sister, if not to fly?"
"Why do we have feet if not to tread upon the soil."
"Ugh, you again."
"Are you following me or something?"
"What have you done with mother's sword?"
"What had to be done."
"Mother must be so proud of all your murders, Kayle."
"Not murder. Justice."
"Are yordles small children?"
"Or large... squirrels?"
"Demacian faith is a hollow shield."
"Demacian lies are pretty."
"A metal heart still breaks."
"Did someone send you here as a joke, Yordle? Did Kayle send you?"
"I am your darkness, I am your truth."
"Let me show you what it is to fall."
"Shall I remind you of your vulnerability?"
"I know how it feels to fall. So will you."
"It takes a cold heart to abandon your family."
"My cold heart is the reason we are alive."
"Kayle. Still the same hair after what, a few hundred years?"
"You hide behind your laws in arrogance, Kayle."
"My laws have more merit than your whims ever will."
"Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me... not. Ughh."
"Loves me, loves me not. Loves me, loves me not. Loves me!"
"Darkness is a gift!"
"Embrace your mistakes!"
"Own your frailty!"
"Into the dark!"
"Feel your guilt!"
"Suffer!"
"Suffer or feel nothing!"
"Darkness rises!"
"Embrace your pain!"
"Revel! You are alive!"
"Feel!"
"Know me by my pain!"
"Do not look away!"
"I make my own justice!"
"Do not run from your shadow!"
"Darkness reveals truth!"
"Feel my pain!"
"Share in my torment!"
"Avoid pain, suffer more!"
"I will show you pain!"
"Suffer as I have!"
"Endure!"
"Endure this!"
"True justice needs compassion!"
"Judge yourself, sister!"
"Justice is never blind!"
"Own your frailty!"
"I am not frail."
"Feel something, anything!"
"Why do you think I wear armor, sister?"
"Suffer as I have!"
"Think you're the only one?"
"I make my own justice!"
"And you damn yourself."
"Justice, how boring!"
"Blind faith is for fools!"
"A sword, cute!"
"Attacking me with my own blade, sister?"
"No mercy!"
"Not even for your twin?"
"What's new?"
"Be Still!"
"Feel this!"
"Remain."
"Circled by your sins!"
"The earth reflects your torment!"
"You thought my magic evil."
"Shielded from yourself."
"You're welcome."
"I didn't say 'thank you'."
"You never do."
"Shielded from yourself."
"I'll ignore that."
"How "
" of you."
"Look what you made me do!"
"I told you to remain!"
"My pain unbound!"
"I will take on everything!"
"I suffered this for you!"
"Flame purifies."
"Oh, am I pure now, sister?"
"I am your salvation!"
"Oh spare me!"
"Redemption in the light!"
"Preach later!"
"Sister!"
"Kayle!"
"Take pride in how swiftly we fall."
"Pain must be felt."
"Mortality is truly divine."
"Send my regards to mother."
"Time to come down to earth."
"Blood for my blood."
"They wanted a villain, I gave them a villain!"
"Home, a place that never leaves you."
"Mortal comforts make immortality bearable."
"The world is a beautiful place. Do not let it be hidden."
"Vision does not require light."
"Darkness is everywhere."
"We shall see through their lies."
"So this... Is how it feels..."
"Ahh... Something new..."
"These mortal cycles begin anew."
"Back into the fray."
"I have endured worse."
"I will bring you all pain!"
"Let's settle this, Kayle!"
"GG!"
"I will never give up... "
