"You know you want me."
"Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied."
"Let's see... whose life shall I ruin today?"
"The moment they think they have me... *laughs* Yeah, that's what I live for."
"This place is so bland. It needs a splash of red."
"Show me the man who has everything, and I'll show you my next victim."
"Oooh, so many joyful people to hurt."
"Hate? No! I hurt them out of love."
"I feel their looks like hot breath. They feel my claws like hot knives."
"Keep them longing, make them plead."
"I only do one night stands."
"Just looking for that special someone to torment."
"I can't feel anything... until they do."
"Every smile is just a frown waiting to be turned upside down."
"The height of their happiness is the depth of their pain."
"This craving will soon be sated."
"Hate and love are just two words for passion."
"I was born of a thousand screams. What's one more?"
"Their mouths say no, but their bodies say 'flay me alive.'"
"Drink the pain, toss away the rest."
"Once I was overwhelmed by the agony. Now I can't get enough."
"You really don't know someone 'til you've seen them beg for mercy."
"I like the happy ones. They have so much farther to fall."
"Without pain, how would they know pleasure?"
"I hurt them 'til they hurt no more."
"Misery loves whatever I tell it to."
"One touch, with desire... that's all I need."
"Someday they'll love me for who I really am."
"My love cuts to the quick."
"Suffering is the meaning of life. Well... their lives."
"Let's see... something to fill the emptiness..."
"I remember when just a little pain did the trick."
"Rend their flesh, flay them head to toe."
"Girls just wanna tear your throat out with their teeth."
"All my exes are dead."
"Need to find me? Just follow the trail of widows."
"I use every part of their torment. Nothing is wasted."
"I don't break hearts. I just tear them from rib cages."
"They're all my favorites... until they break."
"Through suffering they come to love me. Every. Single. One."
"Human. Agony. My two favorite words."
"These curves are real."
"A man once told me to put on some clothes. So I wore his skin."
"Who does a girl have to kill to start another Rune War?"
"They love to watch me leave."
"Always dress like you're seducing your next victim."
"Ah, how their screams make me tingle."
"Don't try to tell me I'm not gorgeous."
"Every kill is just a lover who didn't work out."
"People have too many emotions. What am I supposed to do with 'empathy'?"
"I tasted peace once. Didn't do it for me."
"I've had my eye on you. *giggles* Now I'm gonna rip yours out."
"First time being tortured? Don't worry, I'll do everything."
"I'll suck every last drop of joy from your heart."
"That skin looks good on you, but it would look better on my bedroom floor."
"I don't really have friends. Just people I haven't eviscerated yet."
"What's the point of torturing you?"
"Ugh, I wouldn't torture you if you were the last person on earth."
"With infinite power comes an infinite capacity for pain."
"I can make you do a lot more than jingle, space man."
"Does that... hurt?"
"So, you're a masochist? What'cha doing later?"
"Blindfolds, huh? Whatever does it for ya."
"I've seen your wife. You can do better."
"You seem happy. Let's fix that."
"Why don't we leave the lights on for this?"
"So how are you, River King? I see you haven't missed a meal."
"I like your style, Kench, but stay out of my territory."
"Ooh, I love watching you work."
"How do you kill them so slowly? You have to teach me."
"Have I told you how your parents cried with their final breaths?"
"Don't worry, love. You'll join them soon."
"You look like someone I could hurt for days."
"Can your kind even feel? I don't want to waste my time."
"Just the way I like 'em. Big and stupid."
"Naughty, naughty. That gets you a lashing."
"Pfft, pillow talk."
"I love it when they talk dirty. 'No! Please! Stop torturing me!'"
"Know what else is funny? Pulling your tongue out through your neck."
"Let's find your spot, love."
"Ooh, you're so hot when you're hurt."
"Sealed with a kiss."
"Come on, let's see those tears."
"Scream. It makes it better."
"Enough foreplay!"
"Let me in!"
"Like what you see? I'll rip off your eyelids!"
"Hurting is yummy."
"We're done when I'm done."
"I can't wait to see your pain face."
"Ohh, yes... Cry for me honey."
"My pleasure, your pain."
"Make me feel..."
"Yes... Yes...!"
"I know you're hurting, but I can't feel without this."
"Everyone's pain tastes different. What flavor is yours?"
"Awww, you thought you were getting lucky!"
"They're just so... stabbable!"
"Your fear is delightful."
"Ooh la la!"
"Hey there."
"Whimper."
"Don't be shy."
"Harder? Okay."
"Careful. I'm a biter."
"I hope this hurts."
"Hello, love."
"Let me see you hurt."
"Beg me to stop."
"No...! Don't...! Stop...!"
"Shut up and scream."
"Wanna get outta here?"
"Love at first sight... And last."
"Don't die wishing you'd had this."
"Hope you like it rough."
"Love me."
"Nothing personal, I just need you to suffer horribly."
"The more I cut away, the closer we'll get."
"That's it...!"
"Not the first time I've had dragon."
"What a magnificent creature... Let's kill it slowly!"
"Don't worry, honey, I'm open to all types."
"Cold blooded. Just like me."
"You're a lot to love."
"My... that's a lot of pain."
"The bigger they are, the more places you can hurt them."
"Finally! A man who can satisfy me."
"It's better in the dark."
"Lights out."
"Stalk and seduce."
"The things we whisper in the dark."
"Oooh, I like to watch."
"Let's sneak around."
"They can touch, but they can't look."
"They all look the same in the dark."
"What they don't know won't hurt them... yet."
"Let's play hard to get."
"The night is my veil."
"The things I'm going to do to you."
"That's it, love. Let your guard down."
"Go on, touch me."
"You need to relax."
"Ooh, are you lonely? I can help."
"A little bit of heaven, before the hell."
"How 'bout a kiss?"
"Let Evelynn take over."
"Don't go anywhere."
"I'm not done yet."
"Not yet, honey."
"Play more later?"
"Stay right there, love."
"Wait for me, sweetie."
"Aw, playtime's over."
"I hate it when they don't last."
"It's okay, hun, happens to everyone."
"Look at me! I need to watch you go."
"No, no! Don't die yet!"
"Ugh... I think we should break up."
"Oh well... Time to find a new toy."
"Once again, a woman's left unsatisfied."
"That was fast."
"That was hot."
"Ugh... I thought you'd last longer."
"Was it as good for you as it was for me? No? Too bad!"
"Wanna do it again?"
"We need to talk. I want to kill other people."
"I prefer going naked but... okay."
"It's a sin to cover something so perfect."
"Why not give them something to take off?"
"Hello, hat. Ready to feast on the pain of others?"
"This land will become a sea of torment."
"Even a lich can suffer."
"The pain of a lich is eternal."
"Imagine what we can do with this."
"It's so... big."
"Think of all the places this can go."
"Aahh, still wet with the tears of Liandry herself."
"I do like your style, Liandry, whoever you were."
"Now, they will all know true pain."
"A girl's gotta know when to disappear."
"Be right back. Gotta put my face on."
"Show's over, boys."
"Love 'em and leave 'em."
"Always leave them wanting more."
"Mind if I slip into something a little more... painful?"
"POP/STARS"
"Goodbye, love..."
"I thought... we had something..."
"One last... kiss..."
"So this is pain?"
"Guess who's back for more?"
"Okay. My turn."
"So, they like it rough."
"Ugh, dying is such a turn-off."
