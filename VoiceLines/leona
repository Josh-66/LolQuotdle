"The dawn has arrived."
"I must not fall."
"Rally to me."
"Ever vigilant."
"I must not fall."
"Stay at the vanguard."
"First light approaches."
"The sun always rises."
"I will protect you."
"Chosen of the sun."
"The day is upon us."
"Pen or sword - the shield is mightiest."
"Next time, try to leave a dent!"
"Don't stare directly at me for too long."
"I think I broke a nail. Good thing it wasn't mine."
"Stand and fight."
"Feel the sun's glory."
"They will be sundered."
"Twilight fades."
"I will break their line."
"They'll have to get through me."
"Day breaks upon the battlefield!"
"You'll pay for your heresy, Diana!"
"GG!"
"Alas, the sun sets once again."
