"I can never resist an invitation to dance."
"Fine, I'll just be over here... sharpening my feathers."
"If love is feeling so deeply for another that you want to chew your way under their skin, then I love Rakan... "
"The Vastayan named the world. We named the trees, the wind, the mountains. We know their power."
"The world owes the Vastaya a great debt. I'm here to collect."
"I'm just an ordinary girl. An ordinary girl with an infinite supply of death quills."
"They'll probably label me a war criminal one day, but not today."
"We pledged ourselves to each other in the middle of a tavern brawl. The whole place reeked of vomit, sweat and blood. It was so romantic!"
"Ah, silence, so golden. Like Rakan. Kind of miss him. Even if he is... noisy."
"Let's cut 'em to ribbons."
"Alright, let's go! This way or that way?"
"Stick to the plan."
"We have a plan?"
"We always have a plan."
"Huh. Really?"
"Ugh, I hate everyone today."
"I know what'll make you feel better... "
"Murdering everyone!"
"Hey, I have a plan."
"You... have a plan?"
"Yeah! I'll go on instinct!"
"That's the opposite of a plan."
"You sure about this?"
"It has to be done."
"Be safe."
"Like you can talk."
"If things go wrong---"
"They always go wrong."
"They don't always go wrong."
"Mostly?"
"They mostly go wrong."
"That's why I'm here."
"So, this mission... are we, uh...?"
"Are you pretending to be dumb?"
"Well, I mean... I don't have to remember the plan if you do."
"When are we going to do this?"
"Soon, baby. Slow down."
"Sabotage takes patience and time - and lots of feather daggers."
"I'll do whatever needs to be done - twice, just to be sure."
"Compromise is so unsatisfying."
"Oh, I was born to ruffle feathers."
"Our Vastayan essence fades with each passing day."
"I will rest when our homelands are restored."
"All women desire Rakan. Like they'd know what to do with him."
"They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness."
"We Vastaya are only half of our full glory."
"Rebellion puts the fire in my blood."
"No-one will block my path."
"Talking to anybody about anything is never on my to-do list."
"If our existence is everyone else's chaos, so be it."
"Talking to people makes me want to stab them... so I do."
"Victors are the sole authors of history. Time to write our chapter."
"Tavern brawls just seem to find me."
"Chaos is the preferred state of nature."
"Nature bends towards chaos. Give in, or break."
"I really hate anyone who's not me - or Rakan."
"Nature is wild and untamed, not balanced."
"Humans. They're so very blind."
"Spiders are my spirit animal."
"If Rakan were here, I'd make out with him until his ears bled. He loves it when I do that."
"Ionians never learn."
"Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases."
"I hate flowers. Tiny skulls stuffed with twigs, on the other hand... "
"Sometimes people die for a good cause - namely, mine. That's why I'm an optimist."
"Cloudy days are my favorite."
"I prefer to work at night, because, y'know, the sun? Bright? Yuck!"
"Pandemonium follows me everywhere I go. It's like a puppy I once fed... "
"Ionia used to be so nice - before humans tamed all that wild cataclysmic magic."
"Once, magic was everywhere, or as the Vastaya say: (chants)"
"Ionia's meddling birthed our rebellion."
" Hey, Xayah."
"Yeah?"
"You sexy."
"Keep them distracted."
"That shouldn't be a problem."
"You okay?"
"I'm fine."
"You're pushing yourself too hard."
"It has to be done."
"Where are we going?"
"You forgot the plan."
"No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?"
"You remember the Aphae waterfall?"
"Yeah?"
"I'd like to go there again."
"Well, try not to die then."
"Darling?"
"Yes?"
"Pay attention to me."
"What the hell were you thinking?"
"Back there?"
"Yes."
"I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking."
"How can humans not hear the magic?"
"They're too busy building things."
"Why?"
"Because... they're afraid."
"Thanks."
"For what?"
"Not saying 'I told you so.'"
"Okay, last time, it was totally my fault."
"What was?"
"Good answer."
"You going to marry me today?"
"Ask me again tomorrow."
"I always do."
"Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?"
"Not now!"
"Love is so cruel!"
"What's after this?"
"Another road, another horizon."
"Hm. Good."
"It's gonna' be okay."
"We can do this."
"Hey, I know that."
"You know I love you."
"What we have is greater than some human word."
"Did you notice the sky?"
"It's lovely."
"Not as beautiful as you."
"I am R-r-r-akan!"
"Ugh, what's with the accent?"
"I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?"
"No. No, I do not."
"If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?"
"Hubba hubba."
"No, that's not whistling."
"If you don't want to do this... "
"No! I want to!"
"You're only here because of me."
"... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me."
"What are those things humans wear on their feet?"
"Shoes."
"I need shoes. Red ones. I need them so bad."
"Did I tell you I love you?"
"Yes... but say it anyway."
"I love you."
"Why do you never say yes?"
"'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask."
"Can we just stay here?"
"We must keep moving."
"Aw... "
"Xayah? I think we got a problem... "
"Think, or know?"
"I... know we got a problem?"
"I'm so tired... "
"You gotta rest, honey."
"Everyone is depending on me."
"Everyone can wait."
"What would you do if I died?"
"I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever."
"Aw... that's sweet."
"I think scars are sexy."
"Okay. I'll get more."
"Where do we go?"
"Wherever our hearts desire."
"How do you like me today?"
"More than yesterday, less than tomorrow."
"Do I make you happy, Rakan?"
"Every day of my life."
"I'm lucky to have you."
"No. I'm the lucky one."
"I swear, you will be the death of me."
"I'm fine with that."
"Me too."
"If we get separated, I'll find you."
"We won't get separated."
"You're already wandering off."
"No, I'm not! ... only a little."
"You are stunning and beautiful... "
"Why, thank you, darling."
"Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey."
"I need you to be more careful."
"If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die. Also, black is a terrible color on me."
"Play it safe!"
"Baby, I don't do safe!"
"You okay?"
"Oh, this is all so intense!"
"You can't tell me you weren't impressed!"
"With what?"
"Just generally! I'm amazing!"
"Honey, what are you doing?"
"I can't die looking this good!"
"After this, how about we get some human food?"
"A nice dinner?"
"Chocolate!"
"That's not what---"
"We're eating chocolate!"
"Do you remember the plan?"
"Nope, but let's do it!"
"I have a cunning plan."
"Really? What is it?"
"I'm not going to tell you. That's the really cunning bit!"
"I think you intimidate human females."
"Yeah, so?"
"It's kinda hot!"
"Should I show them the dance?"
"Show them the dance."
"You thinking about me?"
"I'm a little busy!"
"That's very upsetting!"
"Baby, what did I tell you?"
"Try not to die?"
"Close enough."
"Did you see the clothes those guys were wearing?"
"Yeah, gross."
"Rakan has arrived!"
"I saw you. Everyone can see you."
"Yeah! That's what I like!"
"Can I start off?"
"You want to start it off?"
"Let's start it off!"
"I'm a humble entertainer!"
"Really, darling?"
"Yeah, I'm the best."
"Who is that gorgeous thing over there?"
"Now's not the time, darling."
"It's always the time!"
"Hey, I'm not gonna kill you, she is! Say hi, honey."
"Hi."
"I'm handling it, dear."
"Are you?"
"I was, I--- I will."
"How long do we fight?"
"Until we are free. Until magic is free."
"Is that after lunch?"
"Do you remember our escape route?"
"Uh... yes?"
"I'll take that as a no."
"How will we know if the plan works?"
"We'll still be alive!"
"Woo, shake those tail feathers, baby!"
"I am not a piece of meat."
"Caw caw, caw caw!"
"You used the secret call! Is everything alright?"
"We have a secret call? I just like that sound! Caw caw!"
"Hey, I need you here! Uh, never mind, just... go that way!"
"No-one can control me!"
"That's right, babe."
"Look sharp, baby."
"Ha! When don't I?"
"If I vanish, what would you do?"
"I would never be whole again."
"Am I good to you?"
"The best."
"I'm going rogue!"
"There's a surprise."
"Be right back!"
"Will you?"
"Who can know these things?"
"You! You can know these things!"
"I love you!"
"I know."
"Heh, like this... "
"Oh, here we go again. Mhm. Mister Scatman, uh huh. ... oh, he's got me going now... "
"Sing it with me, baby."
"I don't know the words."
"I'm about to ruin your day."
"Please, for the sake of us both, go far away."
"I'm going to murder you a thousand times."
"Am I supposed to be intimidated right now? I'm not sure what's going on."
"Please, don't make me tryhard. I'm not in the mood."
"Can I just hate you to death?"
"I can't even--- I don't know where to begin."
"The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death."
"I will punch your soul in the face."
"I ain't gonna' kill you. She is!"
"Nice to unmeet you."
"Kiss me, honey."
"Why now?"
"Give them a pretty last image."
"Get out there and take a bullet for me - like a gentleman."
"You're not bad for someone who isn't Rakan."
"If we do this right, only one of us get shot."
"Block the hits for me - please?"
"Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?"
"How am I supposed to work with - whatever this is?"
"Don't embarrass me."
"Mages. Too insufferable to live."
"Mages are lucky if they can cast a minor hex."
"Yordles. Why did it have to be Yordles?"
"Yordles are the reason no-one takes us Vastaya seriously."
"Okay. Who invited the Yordle?"
"You want to be mortal? You are mu'takl."
"You betray your heritage, Ahri."
"I don't want to spill Vastayan blood, Rengar."
"We were not made to fight each other."
"Aw, poor sad little mummy! I just want to take you home."
"I don't want to hurt you, space dragon. We could be such good friends."
"I can't wait to burst your bubble."
"Who does your wardrobe? Fire them. Immediately."
"Wait, magic powered sword legs? Is this a joke?"
"Is this another timeline where I beat you up again?"
"When I'm done with Ionia, I'll come for Demacia."
"Where can I get one of those delightful chthonic god-clutch purses? Does it come in purple? The god, not the bag."
"I want your happiness to evaporate."
"I want to travel the world with you."
"But is it really okay?"
"Your talking is not improving this wonderful silence."
"You're gross. Never change."
"You call that a rebellious nature?"
"You call that being a vampire?"
"I'm insulted? I don't know."
"Ouch. I'm going to need some aloe."
"I wasn't listening to what you said, but I sure am outraged."
"Watch your tongue - and your back."
"Say that to my feathers."
"I think we're supposed to laugh, now?"
"At what?"
"Smile and nod, honey."
"Can we leave now?"
"Damnit!"
"I'm not laughing. I needed to say that just so you understand."
"Next time, try using more hard 'k' sounds."
"Ha ha ha."
"Hahaha... I don't know what that is."
"Behold. I am depleted of cares."
"Just... no."
"Get down with me!"
"Aw, yeah, let's get down!"
"Aw, yeah, come on!"
"Alright, put your back in to it!"
"Dust it off!"
"Alright!"
"Dance like your life depends on it."
"Dance."
"Move your feet, or lose some toes."
"Compromise. It's a pain."
"Call me cute again."
"This is how I deal with unwanted attention."
"This is a preemptive 'No'."
"Keep up."
"A dance with me ends in blood."
"Hear. My. Words!"
"Hm, what shall I cut off?"
"I don't speak compromise."
"I always find a weak spot."
"A thousand cuts is only the beginning."
"Cut by a feather? So delicate."
"Violence is my favorite form of negotiation."
"My feathers are priceless."
"They make chaos dance."
"All out of second chances. Sorry."
"Listening. Such a simple concept."
"Okay, so we're doing this."
"Threading the needle."
"Quit crying! It's just a feather."
"When I dance, I lead."
"My last nerve is long gone."
"A Vastayan feather is a kingly gift."
"This was our world first."
"Ever been stabbed by a feather?"
"Yay, someone to throw knives at."
"I leave nasty scars."
"It's only a little prick."
"Are you having fun over there?"
"I can't hear you over all the fun I'm having!"
"The fight's here!, by me!"
"It's the same fight!"
"You're doing this!"
"Doing it!"
"I hate everyone today!"
"Even me?"
"Not you, baby."
"Should we give them a fighting chance?"
"Only if we want to have fun."
"Who do I hit?"
"One of them!"
"Ah."
"This reminds me of our first dates!"
"Good times!"
"Mind if I cut in, Rakan?"
" Be my guest, miella!"
"That was beautiful, baby!"
"You see that?"
"I couldn't miss it!"
"Make them remember!"
"They'll never forget."
"Let's show 'em what we got."
"Happily."
"You love it when I slap fools?"
"You know I do!"
"This is the plan, right?"
"It is now!"
"What do you want to do later?"
"I can think of something."
"You hungry?"
"Can we talk about this later?"
"But... but... food!"
"You're cute today!"
"Eyes on the prize, baby."
"Let me at 'em!"
"Rakan is very enthusiastic."
"I want to show 'em!"
"I adore your energy."
"Do we need any of these fools?"
"Not a single one."
"Use your words!"
"Can't! Punching!"
"I have your back!"
"I have your back!"
"How long since we last danced?"
"Too long."
"These guys look silly!"
"Bunch of weirdos."
"How many fights we gotta win?"
"All of them!"
"Nope!"
"Nope!"
"Nuh uh!"
"Nope!"
"Sit down!"
"Eat it!"
"Didn't see that coming?"
"Gotcha!"
"Gotcha!"
"Gotcha."
"Pinned!"
"Oops, your bad!"
"Oops, your bad."
"Feathers fly!"
"What? They were in my way."
"As far as obstacles go, that was about a... three out of ten?"
"Anyone else want to try?"
"Thanks for the dance."
"Few can keep up with me."
"Alright, who's next?"
"And an F, for effort."
"Got what they deserved."
"I'm overcome with emotion."
"That was for the Vastaya."
"Well, they tried to stop me."
"Well, that's done."
"Hm, dodging seems to be a weak spot of yours."
"I warned you. Oh, wait, did I? Crap. My fault."
"Yep. Easy peasy."
"That's my baby."
"Ah, it was nothing."
"Did I do that?"
"No. That was me."
"Who's counting?"
"Me. I'm counting."
"Miella, I helped, right?"
"Couldn't have done it without you, mieli."
"Every time you do that, it drives me crazy."
"Well. I'll have to do it more often, then."
"Were... they trying?"
"Probably, but there are two of us."
"I love watching you kill."
"I love killing for you."
"Let's make out."
"Haha! Told you!"
"Rakan, let's not gloat. Much."
"Did they deserve it?"
"They deserved it."
"Why do they break so easily?"
"They aren't made like us."
"Pity."
"That was a Vastayan farewell."
"I was trying to have a moment, Rakan."
"Did you see that? Haha! That was amazing!"
"Nice job, babe."
"They couldn't keep up with you."
"Only you can, Rakan."
"Too bad those tails weren't lives."
"We asked you to join."
"This is by your design."
"The Vastaya will sing songs of you. I promise."
"Mu'takl."
"Shame. You could have been so useful alive."
"Every drop of Vastayan blood spilled is a waste."
"Taitah be tervaash."
"It needed to be done."
"Wasn't she just a ray of sunshine? I hate sunshine."
"And that's where plucky optimism gets you."
"Hurray, they all died."
"It's more of a slaughter than a massacre, really."
"I wish they could have seen the looks on their faces."
"Maybe I overdid it."
"I wasn't joking when I said nothing stands in my way."
"A victory for the Vastaya."
"Magic is again unfettered."
"Untied that mystical knot."
"Another minor annoyance reduced to rubble."
"Crumble! Yes!"
"I could dance right now. Aw, but there's more work to be done."
"Can you feel the magic flowing? I can."
"Sabotage looks so good on me."
"I've been known to implode a sacred obelisk or two."
"I will unblock the rivers of Vastayan essence."
"Each totem that falls strengthens the Vastayan cause."
"We rise."
"Another Vastayan victory."
"They should really get a refund from those masons."
"Hm, poor construction. No standards."
"Shoddy construction, through and through."
"Good henchmen are hard to find."
"Next."
"Nothing is ever easy, but that was really easy."
"That was too easy - but so much fun."
"Don't feel bad, they're just magically animated sheets of cloth."
"They mindlessly marched right to their deaths - like everyone in Noxus."
"They dropped something. Their guard."
"This is overpriced - but I must have it."
"I want to buy all the things!"
"I am totally pulling this off."
"What the heck? I deserve it."
"I know I'm being price gouged, but I'll splurge."
"Where did you get all these wonderful things?"
"Is this ethically sourced?"
"Hook me up with that magical creature discount?"
"Do I really need this? Ah... yes."
"But how much does it cost for me?"
"I must know their every move."
"Sometimes, I have to watch my own back."
"Eyeball in the grass."
"I need a strategic viewpoint."
"Let's have a look-see, shall we?"
"This is ambush territory."
"I never walk into a trap unprepared."
"I hate surprises - unless I'm doing the surprising."
"See the enemy, know their mind."
"Rebellions thrive on intelligence."
"And they won't be needing that any more."
"Die, little inanimate spy."
"Found one! Killed it."
"Good thing I didn't do anything embarrassing."
"There's more than one way to blind an enemy."
"Well, that's just an invasion of privacy."
"You okay?"
"Better now."
"I got you!"
"Thanks, babe."
"You're welcome."
"Thank you."
"Thank you!"
"Any time!"
"Thank you, honey!"
"That help?"
"Appreciated!"
"Aw, you're looking out for me!"
"Always."
"Help!"
"Help!"
"Yipes!"
"Yipes!"
"Oh crap, oh crap!"
"Oh crap, oh crap!"
"Somebody?"
"Somebody?"
"Oh no, oh no!"
"Oh no, oh no!"
"SOS!"
"SOS!"
"I don't like this!"
"I don't like this!"
"This is bad!"
"This is bad!"
"Oh, hell nope!"
"Oh, hell nope!"
"Danger zone!"
"Danger zone!"
"Watch it!"
"Watch it!"
"Careful!"
"Careful!"
"Be safe!"
"Be safe!"
"Look out!"
"Look out!"
"Something here!"
"Something here!"
"Not good!"
"Not good!"
"Beware!"
"Beware!"
"That ain't good!"
"That ain't good!"
"Spooky."
"Spooky."
"Danger!"
"Danger!"
"Where are they?"
"Where are they?"
"Where'd they go?"
"Where'd they go?"
"They missing?"
"They missing?"
"They ain't here."
"They ain't here."
"Nobody's here."
"Nobody's here."
"What's going on?"
"What's going on?"
"What's happening?"
"What's happening?"
"Mysterious mystery!"
"Mysterious mystery!"
"They gone?"
"They gone?"
"Heads up!"
"Heads up!"
"On my way!"
"On my way!"
"Coming, love!"
"Coming, love!"
"Here I come!"
"Here I come!"
"On the way!"
"On the way!"
"Heading over!"
"Heading over!"
"Running over!"
"Running over!"
"Bringing the show!"
"Bringing the show!"
"Bringing the fun!"
"Bringing the fun!"
"I'mma coming, I'mma coming!"
"I'mma coming, I'mma coming!"
"There in a sec!"
"There in a sec!"
"I'm going now. Where? Anywhere not here. That's where."
"Well, I'm bored."
"Bored now."
"We gotta go."
"Wait for me!"
"Xayah out."
"Don't leave without me!"
"You going somewhere?"
"Why not?"
"Aw... crap... "
"Rakan... "
"Seriously... ?"
"Uh, seriously... ?"
"Ugh, lame... "
"Ugh, lame... "
"Death was a nice vacation from the tedium - but nothing good can last, I suppose."
"Death was nice and peaceful. Thanks for ruining it."
"I always wanted to be buried and resurrected in this outfit."
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet."
"Oh, I wasn't finished with these fools yet."
