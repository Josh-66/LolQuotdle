"Rest is for the living."
"You reek of fear!"
"It's been too long."
"Battle... yes!"
"When does the killing start?"
"I... do not bleed."
"What am I?"
"No... pain... no... feeling... but hunger... "
"Why do I feel... nothing?"
"What toll have I paid?"
"These wounds bring no pain."
"This hunger... it gnaws."
"The quiet... eats at me."
"Where are they?"
"How many battles have I won?"
"I hated this waiting."
"Where is the thrill of carnage?"
"I need a slaughter!"
"Always marching."
"Forget the faces of the slain."
"Slay the strong, trample the weak!"
"Blood is the wine of victory."
"Cowardice will be met with death."
"Noxus suffers no cowards."
"Death had its chance."
"Only cowards fear death."
"Victory is soaked in blood."
"Break their will and their bones."
"Winning is like breathing."
"Our drums will drown out their screams."
"You reek of fear!"
"Come out and die!"
"Your bones will pave my road to glory!"
"More grist for the mill of war!"
"Your snapping bones are music to my ears!"
"I don't care what your name is!"
"I know you... I want to remember killing you!"
"Time to cut your strings, puppet!"
"One of us will finally die today!"
"We've clashed a thousand times... no more!"
"I killed you once... I'll kill you again!"
"I'll plant that banner in your corpse!"
"Next in line, next to die."
"Today, we'll see if ghosts can bleed."
"Even death trembles before me."
"You will be privileged to die... under my boot!"
"You are not my general!"
"I am not your pawn, Swain!"
"You are weak, Swain! You are no leader!"
"I had a funny bone, then I crushed it. Laugh, worm!"
"The mewling of your orphan children amuses me! How's that for funny?"
"It's murdering time!"
"Your puny body is the only joke here."
"Your... puny body is the only joke here."
"You look just like your ancestor: dead!"
"How many Jarvans must I kill?"
"Four Jarvans, and you're all still failures! That is funny."
"Why don't I have coverage for prosthetics?"
"So, uh, Urgot. We can't hang out any more. I'm cool now."
"Killing, I know."
"Another corpse for the pile."
"Ally, enemy... I don't care."
"They'll never find all your pieces."
"More enemies!"
"My axe is getting cold!"
"I will kill you all!"
"I will break you!"
"I must be sated!"
"Give me an enemy."
"I taste blood in the air."
"I'll use their bones to pick my teeth."
"I will ruin you."
"Raise your weapon!"
"Your life is mine!"
"I'll pull you apart!"
"I'll rip your head from your spine!"
"Your cries disgust me!"
"Bleed for me!"
"I'll grind you to dust!"
"I'll drown you in your own blood!"
"I'll rip the meat from your bones!"
"Blood will spill!"
"I'll drink from your skull!"
"Drink their blood!"
"Run from me!"
"I'll whet my axe on your bones!"
"Blood!"
"War!"
"Kill!"
"Bleed!"
"Die!"
"Maim!"
"Tear!"
"Crush!"
"Shattered earth and bodies!"
"Broken stone, broken bones!"
"Quake and die!"
"Die and be silent!"
"Feel that?"
"Crumble!"
"You are worms!"
"A black eye for the earth!"
"Even the ground trembles!"
"Leave no stone unbroken!"
"You're nothing!"
"My blood burns."
"Heat... and... rage!"
"Fire in my veins!"
"I feel no pain!"
"Is that all?"
"Think you can take me?"
"You can't even scratch me!"
"I hear the screams!"
"The din of the dying!"
"Out of my way!"
"Worms!"
"Scatter!"
"You can't hide behind lackeys!"
"Pathetic!"
"You're mine!"
"Get up! Fight!"
"Is this what passes for war?!"
"Chaaaaaaaarge!"
"Noxus!"
"I'll crush you all!"
"Dieeeeee!"
"Nothing will stop me!"
"Vermin!"
"I! Am! War!"
"Cowards!"
"The hunger, it grows!"
"You all die too quickly!"
"Stack the bodies higher!"
"I'll make a mountain of the dead!"
"The spoils of war."
"I will drench it in their blood."
"I'll bury it in their skulls."
"If it breaks, so will you."
"I'll break it in."
"Hand it over before I kill you."
"Another trinket to be shattered."
"It will do."
"No mere spell will stop me."
"A sword lacks heft."
"This cleaver... will be red soon."
"This is not the first dead king's weapon I've taken."
"It longs to kill."
"Yes... I like this weapon."
"These will wade through the blood of thousands."
"Nothing will keep me from battle."
"Every step will crack the earth."
"Good enough to stomp insects."
"This will stop their flailing!"
"Do you feel a shiver down your spine?"
"Ah... cold fear."
"I'll shatter the gates of Demacia with this hammer!"
"Cold as the grip of death!"
"I'll feel their bodies grow cold."
"This will sever a thousand heads."
"Spells... hmph."
"Protection from the bites of gnats."
"A dark omen for my enemies!"
"They will break first."
"All will burn in my wake."
"They'll beg as they burn."
"Fire... good... "
"Leave no wound unanswered."
"This was made for war, as am I!"
"This is the only fortress I need!"
"This has seen many battles."
"Battle scarred... I like it."
"Show me the enemy."
"Let them sneak, then let them die."
"A trap for vermin."
"This is the ground you'll die on!"
"Running is futile!"
"Where are you going? Nowhere!"
"This battle is done."
"They can cower a little longer."
"I'll be back."
"I'll be back."
"The enemy awaits."
"There's death to deal."
"I... feel... alive!"
"Blood... on my... hands! This I remember!"
"I do not tire! I do not bleed!"
"More! More!"
"Losing... myself... "
"Not yet... I can hang on... "
"My... mind... will not dim!"
"Slipping... "
"I must live again... "
"I crave more!"
"Come beat me if you want to win."
"GG!"
"We'll be back."
"We'll see you soon."
