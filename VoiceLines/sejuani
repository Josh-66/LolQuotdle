"Trust nothing but your strength."
"I won't be denied!"
"You own what you take."

"I will rule the Freljord."
"Pain is nothing."
"Ride onward!"
"Easy, Bristle. The archer's mine."
"Which will snap more easily? The bow, or you?"
"Ice Witch, prepare to be shattered!"
"Are icicles the best you can muster?"
"Flee like the cowards you are!"
"Don't worry, Bristle, I'll leave you the scraps."
"Those who oppose me get gored."
"Who wants a treat? Bristle wants a treat? Not until we've trampled our foes to dust!"
"Can you smell coward, Bristle? Get 'em!"
"They will feed my boar."
"Die with weapon in hand."
"Prove your worth."
"Trample them!"

"Stand and fight!"
"I won't be denied!"
"I was forged by winter."
"Show them our teeth."
"Run them down!"
"Bristle, attack!"
"Leave no survivors."
"Seize what's ours."
"I rule the Freljord."
"We settle this, here, and now!"
"Stampede!"
"Charge!"
"Die!"
"There's no use running!"
"A gift from the Freljord!"
"We settle this, here, and now!"
"I rule the Freljord."
