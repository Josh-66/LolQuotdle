"Know that if the tables were turned, I would show you no mercy!"
"Your commands tire me."
"I smell death."
"Yes! (Laughs)"
"Stalking prey again?"
"Suffering awaits."
"The magic, it calls to me!"
"Your commands tire me."
"'It's only a short way'? Is that a short joke?!"
"You deny the darkness in your soul! You deny your power!"
"What's black and blue and is about to show you the definition of pain?!"
"I will swallow your soul."
"Even death trembles in my presence."
"Give up now!"
"Even now, your loved ones suffer!"
"I can see the fear in your heart."
"Your soul will come to serve me."
"I am evil! Stop laughing!"
"This will be a short game! Wait..."
"No! No! No! This isn't over!"
"GG!"
