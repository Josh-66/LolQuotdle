"Blood runs... they all run."
"They fear me. They should."
"The chains are broken... the beast is free."
"The blood you spilled calls to me."
"Oh, what a day. What a bloody day."
"Violence supercharged!"
"Blood and chrome!"
"I am in control."
"Can't save you all... don't want to."
"I became the monster I always was."
"The man I was... I killed him first."
"Try to hide."
"The memories come back every time you scream."
"I can smell everything."
"Vengeance is only a step behind you."
"You made the monster."
"Zaun will watch you bleed, and it will do nothing."
"All the blood you've spilled brought me here."
"Zaun will fight back!"
"You know what you've done."
"The city is my hunting ground."
"This place is familiar..."
"Run faster!"
"The beast grows stronger."
"Run... while you can."
"I know Zaun's streets like the back of my claws."
"All... is anger!"
"Give in... the beast!"
"In... control...!"
"Broken...!"
"Pain... nothing!"
"Hero... die!"
"Fear me!"
"Watch you bleed!"
"What have you done?!"
"No screams!"
"Seeking... hunting..."
"Blood spilled!"
"Run, faster!"
"Men... slaughter..."
"Bite back!"
"Killing... remember!"
"Can't... save you...!"
"I became... monster!"
"Hurting you..."
"Claws... hungry!"
"Blood's on me!"
"Try... hide!"
"Violence can be death - or a way of life."
"I ran these streets - now it's your turn to run."
"Nine tails to chase!"
"Zaun has enough shadows."
"There's more to kill in a plague rat. You're all machine."
"So deep in Piltover's pockets, I can only see your hat."
"Blood, hextech and... (sniffs) tea."
"Progress is just what Piltovans call murder."
"I'll pick my teeth with your legs!"
"Rewind too far, and you'll be back in my teeth!"
"The one person in Zaun who runs to the past."
"I'll show you pain!"
"You were there..."
"Let me forget..."
"Which one of you is the wolf?"
"From a roar to a scream!"
"You can't even kill an insect."
"Zaun gave me claws long before you did."
"Can't outrun your mistakes!"
"You're going to need more bandages!"
"I remember what you did!"
"Eat your heart out."
"There are more rats than men in Zaun."
"And I thought the chem-barons were vermin."
"Which one of us is the monster?"
"Zaun needed you!"
"Who taught you how to punch?"
"The fear in your eyes. I've seen it before."
"Three arms... and no claws."
"I don't know what you are, but I hope you bleed!"
"Zaun has enough shadows."
"First I'll kill you, and then I'll--- yordle!"
"Yordles. The alpha predator."
"I'll do a trick for a Warwick snack!"
"Scratch behind my ears..."
"Who's a good boy? I am!"
"Blood is the price."
"You'll answer to me."
"It's not the beast you should be afraid of."
"Killing, I remember."
"Heroes always die!"
"If you die, how many live?"
"Blood brings rage."
"The killing stops when Zaun is free."
"A monster's inside you... I'll tear it out!"
"Give in to the beast."
"Like men to the slaughter."
"It takes a monster to gut one."
"You hurt them, I hurt you."
"You'll choke on your screams."
"You're the prey!"
"Less talking, more biting!"
"Bones to break."
"This pain is nothing."
"This is who I am."
"You die next."
"Not even your screams will escape."
"Can't... save you...!"
"Try... hide!"
"Run... faster!"
"Pain... nothing!"
"Broken...!"
"Claws... hungry!"
"Give in... the beast!"
"Bite back!"
"I became... monster!"
"Watch you bleed!"
"Men... slaughter..."
"Blood spilled!"
"Fear me!"
"Seeking... hunting..."
"In... control...!"
"Killing... remember!"
"Hero... die!"
"No screams!"
"All... is anger!"
"Blood's on me!"
"Hurting you..."
"What have you done?!"
