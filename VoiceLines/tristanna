"Once a Bandle gunner, always a Bandle gunner!"
"Let me get in there!"
"I call frontline."
"I bravely volunteer to charge in recklessly!"
"Locked, loaded, and ready to rocket!"
"Walking tall."
"Where's the action?"
"Bring on the bad guys!"
"Who wears a helmet?"
"Get in my way. I dare ya."
"I dare you to dare me."
"You don't hurt 'em if you don't hit 'em."
"Sometimes outnumbered; never outgunned."
"Let me get in there!"
"Winners don't duck."
"Let's get this party started!"
"I just need a point in the right direction."
"I might just drop in."
"A Bandle Gunner never turns tail. Unless it's to taunt you."
"Orders are more like guidelines, really."
"Wanna see the fireworks?"
"If it's worth shooting once, it's probably worth shooting a lot!"
"You think you can outshoot me?"
"You make it easy to be unimpressed."
"Tada."
"Anyone ever tell you you're a little clingy?"
"Is that gun full-sized?"
"Try to keep up, old-timer."
"You're not the only Yordle who knows how to fly, Corki."
"When you find the right gun, you only need one."
"Aw, Veigar! You're cute when you're angry."
"Oh, Veigar! Tell me all about your diabolical plan."
"Watch where you're exploding, Ziggs!"
"Is that a rocket in your pocket?"
"Please allow my cannon and I to conflict resolve."
"This is my 357 caliber handgun."
"A cannonball is the best icebreaker!"
"Hey, specs. What's cooking?"
"Nice suit, Rumble! What d'you call it?"
"Eyes on the enemy, Rumble."
"Um, Teemo, are these mushrooms your rations or your ammo?"
"Let 'em come by land, by sea or air! Send 'em running home when the Bandle Gunners blare!"
"One stump high and ten stumps tall! Bandle Gunners show 'em all!"
"Bandle Gunners, what'd you see? Sir, just smoke and victory!"
"I'm going in!"
"Engaging!"
"Let's get in range!"
"I can eyeball it!"
"Nothing a little gunpowder won't fix!"
"Check the kick on this sucker!"
"Things are heating up!"
"Watch this."
"Here comes the boom!"
"I got this one!"
"We've got this!"
"Light 'em up!"
"Direct hit!"
"Boomer says hi."
"Ready, aim, fire!"
"War stories don't write themselves."
"Blast 'em!"
"They joined the wrong army!"
"Leave it to me!"
"Hey, where'd you go?"
"Get chunked."
"Double time!"
"Fire at will!"
"Don't let up!"
"Now we're cooking!"
"Who wants some? You want some? Come on!"
"More where that came from."
"Look out below!"
"Blast off!"
"Just passin' through!"
"Up and over!"
"Short cut!"
"Surprise!"
"Didn't see that coming, did you?"
"Thanks for breaking my fall!"
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Splat."
"Oh boy!"
"Eep!"
"Can't touch this!"
"Almost!"
"Whoa!"
"Retreat!"
"Maybe I cut that a little close. Maybe."
"Any landing you can walk away from..."
"I was never worried!"
"Need a breather..."
"Aha, haha, ha... that was scary."
"Can't wait to tell the recruits about that one!"
"Stuck him."
"Hold this."
"Mind the fuse."
"Tag."
"Tick tock."
"Clock's ticking."
"Haha, you're in trouble now."
"Dropping like flies!"
"Thanks for clumping!"
"Keep 'em coming!"
"Clean sweep."
"Pfft. Cannon fodder."
"Nothing like overkill!"
"Target freaking annihilated!"
"Now you see him, now you don't."
"How's that for a Bandle City beatdown?"
"Nope!"
"See ya."
"Cannonball!"
"Over there, buster!"
"Hi there!"
"Hands off!"
"Point blank is the only blank I like!"
"Air mail!"
"Boo!"
"Pilot to bombardier!"
"Bombs away!"
"You should try fanning out!"
"Do you sell earplugs too?"
"Oh, that looks cool!"
"Is this blastproof?"
"Let's see if this makes it through the first explosion."
"Can't wait to try this out."
"Ooh, I like the look of this baby!"
"Does this make me royalty?"
"Sweet! Kinda gross but sweet!"
"It can keep the blood. I'm thirsty for action."
"All the risk and none of the consequences? I'm sold!"
"Time to live dangerously."
"Some people like backup plans. I like 'charge in' plans!"
"Infinity anything is pretty awesome."
"If there's a sword for making things explode, this is it."
"It won't be so much a whisper as a deafening explosion."
"Cannons versus armor; cannons win."
"I don't take cover. I take cover out."
"No slowing me down now!"
"Perfect for cutting loose!"
"Nets, snares, vines, meet your worst nightmare."
"Time to fill up my dance card!"
"This'll put a little zing on things!"
"Ooh, look! I'm a shock trooper!"
"Who needs a fort?"
"You're gonna need a bigger castle."
"Bringing down the house!"
"Huff, puff, boom."
"On lookout."
"Watch the brush."
"Eyes open."
"Watching our backs."
"Time for some rearm and redeploy!"
"Falling back!"
"Back to base!"
"Back to the action!"
"Gotta get back out there!"
"Up and at 'em!"
"Two-fer!"
"Score!"
"Full house!"
"Ready for some fireworks?"
"GG!"
"Well, I had a blast!"
