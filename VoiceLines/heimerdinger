"Indeed, a wise choice."
"How befuddling!"
"The cosine of U-root, divided by... "
"Hmm... very interesting!"
"I could do that better."
"Order, entropy; a never-ending cycle."
"I concur!"
"Yes, yes, hurry, I have important work to get back to!"
"Hmm... let me fix that."
"Wonderfully efficient!"
"Goggles on!"
"By my calculations... "
"Did I leave the Tridyminiumobulator on?"
"Just as I hypothesized!"
"Aha!"
"How befuddling!"
"I put the scheme in schematic!"
"What an uncommon denominator!"
"Back to the drawing board!"
"Aha, 42, I knew it! Now - er, what was the question again?"
"42... there's just something about that number."
"I do love a good conundrum."
"Every problem solved is another revealed."
"One step closer to greater understanding!"
"Fascinating, isn't it?"
"Not enough variables... hmm... not nearly enough variables."
"Order, entropy; a never ending cycle. Or is it?"
"Brain over brawn!"
"I prefer a battle of wits, but you're unarmed!"
"Don't worry, you can learn so much from failure."
"Ah, Jayce. Mind if I borrow some of your 'hexpertise'?"
"Groundbreaking hextech innovation employed in the service... of punching."
"I don't agree with your methods, but by golly, do you get results!"
"If you seek to replace all humans, there will be no one left to appreciate your work."
"Have you considered making quieter hexplosives?"
"Your hexplosives are disturbing my research."
"Would you mind taking your hexplosives elsewhere?"
"Why do chemists call helium, curium, and barium 'the medical elements'? Because, if you can't 'helium' or 'curium', you 'barium'! Hm hm!"
"Why do people say 'you can't trust atoms'? Because they 'make up everything'! Hehe!"
"There are three key ingredients to invention: excessive imagination, good old fashioned stick-to-it-iveness, and a rocking good hairstyle!"
"Eureka!"
"Eureka!!"
"For great science!"
"I theorize... your defeat!"
"Back, you dirty ape, back!"
"You are poorly designed for this!"
"What a reaction!"
"Working as intended!"
"Exceeding turret output capacity!"
"Stop that! You will damage my turrets!"
"Raise your what?"
"This behaviour is highly inefficient!"
"Testing in progress!"
"This calls for a prototype!"
"I've applied the formula for success!"
"Mind your vectors!"
"I require my adjustable reverse-ratcheting magnetic box wrench!"
"Stand back! I am about to do... science!"
"They'll have a few screws loose by the end of this!"
"This will put a wrench in their plans!"
"Hmm, it's smaller than the diagram."
"Rise, my creation!"
"It's gone mad!"
"Ah, the sweet smell of science!"
"Perhaps I should try more rockets!"
"No, not all the rockets!"
"Come on... nngh... ?! WAAAAA--- "
