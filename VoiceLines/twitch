"What doesn't kill you just isn't finished yet."
"I'm on to you!"
"Hey, what did I step in?"
"From out of the sewers comes... doom."
"Who let all these plants survive?"
"Ohoho, yes, yes..."
"What's 'sharing'?"
"Don't trust any liquid that you can see through."
"It's sticky so you don't drop it."
"I can't even taste the air up here, bleugh."
"They're planning something, I know it."
"I'm on to you!"
"All pipes lead to home."
"Rust is like more delicious mold."
"Who's following me?"
"Hop on, lice."
"They are the plague."
"Watch your step."
"Have you met my fleas?"
"Are you gonna finish that?"
"Aged like a fine egg."
"Dip it in sewage... leave it in the sun for a while... oh, yes, that's perfect, yes!"
"Stop moving my stench!"
"The only thing the sun's good for, is what it does to milk."
"I have this... uncontrollable urge to follow you."
"I see why everyone chases you."
"Oohoohoo, Singed! You smell nice!"
"I thought this place could use a little gooping up!"
"You remind me of home."
"I hear you're trash. Bow before your king!"
"They can play this at your funeral."
"I'm dedicating this piece to you."
"One of these is going to get stuck in your head."
"I'm a connoisseur of the finer things!"
"Sneaking around really works up your appetite!"
"Always pack a snack a month in advance!"
"Ah, finally ripe!"
"I demand tribute!"
"Look what the pipes washed in."
"I dealt it! It was me!"
"Mine!"
"Ripe for the picking."
"Stand still! My eyes are on the side of my head!"
"I demand a sandwich!"
"Aim, then shoot. Aim, then shoot."
"It'll only hurt 'til you die."
"Boop!"
"Plenty more where that came from! Seriously, I carry a lot of ammo."
"I greased these all myself."
"I licked this bolt for you."
"Ohoho, that's gonna fester."
"How do you aim with all this light?"
"What's yours is mine."
"They'll have more holes than my favorite cheese."
"Exterminate this!"
"Shooting's easy. Aiming's hard."
"Hope that gets infected."
"No touching!"
"I'll be right under their noses..."
"Time to go."
"Sneaky, sneaky..."
"It's me! Hahahahaa!"
"Hi!"
"Oh, hello! Huhahahahaa!"
"I was hiding! Hehehahaa, grr!"
"You're welcome!"
"I'm gonna want that back!"
"Now, there's a smell you can feel!"
"Here's something that won't wash off!"
"You're looking a little green!"
"Share this!"
"Sewer skewers for everybody!"
"Pins and needles!"
"Ah, a little stench and it'll be perfect."
"Aww, this doesn't smell at all."
"It's mine. I licked it."
"Shiny, not for long."
"Shiny? Ugh."
"This will do."
"My ears are tingling. My... tail is tingling."
"You drink this?"
"Oof, this'll put hair on your tail."
"Needs more... sludge."
"My last whisper will be yogurt mold."
"My last whisper will be maggot pie, ooh."
"My last whisper will be street bacon."
"My last whisper will be curdle pops."
"Nobody sneaks into my turf."
"Trespassers will be shot, then looted, then... chewed on for a while!"
"I need these for my stash."
"D'aww, it's not even stale yet!"
"Bleurgh, this tastes awful!"
"Trespassers will be gnawed."
"Keep out."
"I'm watching."
