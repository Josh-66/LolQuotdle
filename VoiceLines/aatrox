"Now, hear the silence of annihilation!"
"Let me end this!"
"Pantheon, I see you! Like a lamprey you attach yourself to a host! I will carve you from this mortal's form, and eviscerate you both!"
"Pantheon! I will crush your godhood, I will eviscerate your ideals, even your memory... I will trample!"
"Targon sends an aspect against me? Prepare yourself, Pantheon, I will end all that you hope to be!"
"They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed... Noble is this carnage."
"I am your reckoner, mortals."
"Challenge me, mortals! I am here!"
"Am I the abyss? Or did I gaze into it?"
"The only peace I seek... is death!"
"I am oblivion, I am destruction... I am doom."
"The true sound of my blade can only be heard when they loathe re-incarnation."
"This cursed form... This crude decaying flesh! I loathe it!"
"Let them lament... my name."
"I stood against the void. Now... I would welcome it."
"I cannot die... until all life ends."
"Primitives worship me, hoping for mercy. I shall give them death."
"They will call me a god killer!"
"I am doom!"
"As long as this form lives, I will punish them."
"My suffering... I will make it bloom."
"My darkness was not born, it was forged by my prison."
"I am not a king, I am not a god, I am... worse..."
"Those who call me enemy, I welcome them."
"I will snuff out the light, I shall make darkness eternal!"
"All that lives, I will end!"
"There is a darkness in my heart deeper than any shadow!"
"I march to death... Though I wish it was my own..."
"I will drown them in oceans of blood!"
"Patience, Aatrox! Patience! Your freedom will come!"
"Gods and mortals, they deserve only death!"
"Kneel mortals! So I may split your shoulders from your spine!"
"March toward vengeance... Drown this world in blood!"
"I must destroy even hope."
"For my imprisonment, they will suffer!"
"I will render these mortals' forms into my own!"
"Their screams will be like the soothing hum of insects at dusk."
"They will call me villain... Come, let me earn their hatred, again and forever."
"We had another name once... Now, we are Darkin."
"I am ready to be the World-Ender!"
"I am Aatrox, I am the World-Ender!"
"Carnage, hate, yes! I am the World-Ender!"
"Take everything from them! Become the World-Ender!"
"Insects, the World-Ender has come!"
" *Heavy breathing* "

" *Grunt* "

"Mastery? I must congratulate you, obviously your parents never had reason to."
"Yes, your mastery is the master of masters! I am fighting... an imbecile..."
"Somehow, I doubt you've mastered self-esteem."
"Mastery, how I idolise your greatness! Though I suspect your weapon lacks... impact."
"Ah, mastery, well done! Now master your insignificance."
