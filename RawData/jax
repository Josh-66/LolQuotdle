Trivia

Original Jax Original Jax

    In Co-op vs. AI matches, Jax Bot's greeting line; "Who wants a piece of the champ?", and his line upon the players' victory; "Imagine if I had a real weapon!", were directly taken from his taunt and joke lines respectively:
         
           "Who wants a piece of the champ?!"
         
           "Imagine if I had a real weapon!"

Jaximus Jaximus

     
       "Here's to you, kid!" references Joe, an Ewing's sarcoma patient who, thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, was able to visit Riot Games Inc.'s headquarters.
        Jaximus Jaximus was Joe's favorite skin, and after he passed away in 05-Jun-2012, the Grandmaster at Arms says the line in his memory.[1]
            As a result, he became the first non-Legendary skin to have a special line.

Mecha Kingdoms Jax Mecha Kingdoms Jax

     
       "Would you look at that? I finally have a real weapon." and  
       "Maybe use a real weapon next time." are a reference to his default voiceline's joke.
     
       "This is the best thing since boiled eggs." and  
       "My hobbies include saving people, defending kingdoms, and eating eggs boiled at optimal temperatures." reference his love for boiled eggs.
        All three of his joke lines also make this reference:
             
               "I like my action the way I like my eggs: hard-boiled."
                This is also possibly a reference to the famous Hong Kong action movie of the same name.
             
               "Little known fact, peeling eggs takes longer than saving kingdoms."
             
               "My happy place is peace, quiet, and a boiled egg."
     
       "Kid, you're a true warrior." references the same aforementioned individual known as Joe.
