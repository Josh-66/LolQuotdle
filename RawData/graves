Trivia

Original Graves Original Graves

     
       "I ain't got time to bleed." references the same line from Predator.
        A side-by-side comparison of the original line can be seen here.
     
       "Dead man walkin'." references death row.
     
       "Feelin' lucky?" might be referencing the eponymous character from Dirty Harry played by actor Clint Eastwood. ("You've gotta ask yourself one question; do I feel lucky? Well do ya, punk?") Eastwood also played the aforementioned Man With No Name from the Dollars Trilogy, another possible source of inspiration for Graves.
     
       "End of the line." might be referencing a 1988s Country/Rock song End of the Line by the Traveling Wilburys.
    In the Polish localization, he says:
        "Ciemność widzę" "Ciemność widzę" ("I see darkness") referencing Sexmission.
        "Zawsze sikasz przez zapięty rozporek?" ("You always pee with the slit closed?") referencing Kiler.
        "W imię zasad" ("In the name of the rules") and "Co Ty wiesz o zabijaniu?" ("What do you know about killing people?") referencing Pigs.
        "Wyrwałem chwasta" ("I pulled out the weed" meaning he killed someone for being bad) referencing Pigs 2: The Last Blood.
