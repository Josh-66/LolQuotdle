       "It's my business to know what others do not."
     
       "I'm not here to serve. I'm here to protect."
     
       "Let's investigate."
     
       "I must always be three steps ahead."
     
       "I cannot afford to falter."

       "Let's crack this case wide open."
     
       "Hot on the trail."
     
       "I'll have this finished before tea time."
     
       "I love a good chase."
     
       "Me, miss? Not by a long shot."
     
       "I'm on the job."
     
       "Even the smallest clue can break a case."

       "They cannot run from the long arm of the law... nor from the scope of my rifle."
     
       "I am not Piltover's dog. I work for its people, no one else."
     
       "No matter the situation, a good investigator always remains calm."
