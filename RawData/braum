Trivia

    Braum's speech is unusual in that his has a heavy accent compared to other Freljordians as well occasionally referring to himself in the third person.
        Braum features a lot more champion interactions directed at people he's actually to meet down in bottom lane (Marksman icon.png Marksmen and Support icon.png Supports) compared to ones directed at lore-related characters.
     
       "The darker the night, the brighter the stars." is a reference to rhyme by Apollon Maykov.
     
       "Mother always said: 'Float like iceberg, sting like thrown iceberg!'" references Muhammad Ali's catchphrase "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."
    Braum is the first champion to have lines for a successful Recall Recall.
        He is also the fourth to have item-purchase-related quotes, the others being Rengar Rengar, Twitch Twitch, and Karthus Karthus.
    In the Latin America localization, "Si te portas mal, hay puerta!" ('If you misbehave, that's a doorin'!') references "That's a paddlin'" from The Simpsons.
