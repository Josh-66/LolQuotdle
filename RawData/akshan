Pick

     
       "Fixing the world, one scoundrel at a time!"

Ban

     
       "I'm going to remember this."

Akshan_Special_Interactions
Movement
First Move

     
       "Shadya would approve of this. I think. You could never tell with her."
     
       "So... this is what it's like to have friends."
     
       "This cape is not up to Sentinel Code. But, neither is the grappling hook, nor the boomerang."
     
       "We are not helpless. We are the ones who shape our destinies. Now, let's go shoot these villains in the face."
     
       "There is no such thing as fate. But there is such a thing as Akshan."

Moving

     
       "He who takes a life bears its mark on his soul."
     
       "Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later."
     
       "Mmm, yes. Villainy is near."
     
       "Can't talk. Sentinel business. Super important."
     
       "Ha ha! The thrill of going where you're not supposed to."
     
       "Some people deserve a low blow."
     
       "I hate shooting them in the back. I don't get to see their surprise."
     
       "Sometimes fate just needs a little nudge."
     
       "Things to do. Scores to settle."
     
       "The world won't save itself. You know."
     
       "Some people just don't want to pay with their lives."
     
       "A villain will show you much when they don't know you are watching."
     
       "I once knew someone who followed the rules. She's dead."
     
       "I do not break rules. I bend them. Ever so slightly."
     
       "Just desserts coming right up."
     
       "Curse this nagging conscience of mine."
     
       "A scoundrel left alone will always be a scoundrel."
     
       "People without grappling hooks, what are they thinking?"
     
       "Once they see me, it is too late for forgiveness."
     
       "Who am I to decide who lives and dies? Huh. Just a guy."
     
       "Death? I laugh at death! Ha! Listen to me laugh!"
     
       "Okay, villains. Time to soil yourselves."
     
       "Talk is worthless. We are what we do."
     
       "I've got quite a few tricks up my cape."
     
       "I live by my own code. Don't be an ass."
     
       "How well I know the silence of a lonely life."
     
       "Huh, nice place. Lotta things to swing from."

Long Move

     
       "It's important to stride into the wind so the cape flutters dramatically behind."
     
       "Vengeance is not a healthy impulse. Here's to bad health!"
     
       "Some people say I hold a grudge too long but... those people are dead."
     
       "What else can I add to this gun? Maybe a shovel. No-a ladder!"
     
       "How does this boomerang return? Someday I'm going to learn its secrets."
     
       "'Don't use the absolver', they said. 'No one must wield such a weapon'. Eh, I disagree."
     
       "Not everything happens for a reason. Some things need to be sorted out."

Long moving to avenge an Ally Champion

     
       "You try to rest and some lowlife kills one of your pals. Such is life."
     
       "They take one of mine. I take one of theirs."
     
       "Here we go. Get in. Avenge fallen ally. Get out."
     
       "A friend has gone silent. Let's wake them up shall we?"
     
       "The bad part about having friends? Always having to avenge them."
     
       "I can feel them shaking in their armor. I love this part."
     
       "Listen to them. 'Oh no, is Akshan coming to kill me?' Hahahahaha. I am!"
     
       "Shadya would not approve of this act of vengeance but... she wouldn't approve of a lot of things."
     
       "I hear the dead crying out for vengeance. I am coming, friend!"
     
       "Killing this person won't bring my friend back. Actually, it will! Let's go do that."

       "I've got something for you. It's... comeuppance."
     
       "I know what you're feeling. It's regret."
