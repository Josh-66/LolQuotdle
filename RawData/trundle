Trivia

Original Trundle Original Trundle

     
       "The Trolls are going to war!" may be a direct reference to "The Ents are going to war." quoted by Treebeard in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
     
       "Hahaha! Sunlight? Really?" is most likely a reference to the myth that trolls turn to stone under sunlight in certain legends and fantasy universes ("The Hobbit" being a notable example).
        In Norse mythology, it was the dwarves who turned into stones when exposed to sunlight.
    Trundle shares quotes with:

Traditional Trundle Traditional Trundle

    His quotes make several references to internet "trolls", a derogatory term for someone who intentionally annoys or offends another person.
     
       "Don't hate the player, hate the club that's smashing your face!" is most likely a re-phrasal of the famous phrase, "Don't hate the player, hate the game". It could be also a joke from Riot implying that players focus their hate on champions rather than other players.
     
       "How much you wanna bet I can whack you from one fountain to the other?", is most likely a reference to the movie Napoleon Dynamite, in which the character Uncle Rico at one point asks, "How much you wanna make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?", while reminiscing of his past in football.
