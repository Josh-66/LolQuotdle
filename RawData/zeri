       "You know what? We might die here. Let's make sure we go down swinging."
     
       "Yell if you need backup. I'll be there in no time."
     
       "Zaun's with me every fight. This time's no different."
     
       "Sweet, we're here. Whoa, crazy weapons! This team's great. Let's go!"
     
       "Ayy, this is cool. Lotsa places to run. Charging up oughta be quick."

       "If it matters to my team, it matters to me."
     
       "Man, I should've packed more snacks."
     
       "Anyone have a plan? No? No problem."
     
       "Everyone's counting on me. No way I let them down."
     
       "Mistakes made are lessons learned."
     
       "Best thing I can do is fight when others can't."
     
       "I belong here. We all belong here."
     
       "I faced worse in Zaun. We can win."
     
       "Ah, fresh air. A rare treat."
     
       "Lightning in a gun coming through."
     
       "Gun's not broken yet. Better keep it that way."
     
       "Fight's gettin' messy. At least I'm consistent."
     
       "Never seen so little traffic. Do I miss it?"
     
       "Gotta hurry. People need my spark!"
     
       "Giving up's too easy."
     
       "Do or die. I'm all in."
     
       "This won't be perfect, but life never is."
     
       "No slowing down."
     
       "Quick feet, quick trigger."
     
       "I don't leave others behind."
     
       "They're like the chem-barons. Talk big, but they'll break."

Long Move

     
       "No one catches me. Except for my aunt. Man, I can't get anything past her."
     
       "I stood up for my community. I can stand up for others, too."
     
       "Oh, wow. They're really out to get us. I gotta be faster."
     
       "Run fast, charge up, shoot the bad guys. Easy enough."
     
       "Grandma said: 'Never back down from a fight.' Bless that woman."

Trivia

    "I belong here. We all belong here." was put in by Michael 'SkiptomyLuo' Luo as a response to an article on a Filipino-targeted hate crime, with the attacker saying "You don't belong here". Neon from Valorant icon.png Valorant also has this voiceline for the same reason.[1]
