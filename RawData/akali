Early Game

     
       "No one tells me what to do. Not anymore."
     
       "Cold steel and a target are all I need."
     
       "I love what I do, my enemies won't."
     
       "They can't stop me. I mean, they can try."
     
       "I work alone, it's better for everyone."
     
       "If they're smart, they're scared."
     
       "I am my own master. Just the way I like it."

Mid Game

     
       "Wars are messy. My kills are clean."
     
       "Everyone dies, I just speed things up."
     
       "You can never have too many kunai."
     
       "Don't waste the anger, channel it."
     
       "No more meditation or masters."
     
       "Youth and skill, every time."
     
       "Let 'em see me, they can't stop me."
     
       "The words on their tombstones will be my new mantras."
     
       "Kama or kunai? Depends how I'm feelin'."
     
       "It's not about the killing, it's about who's doing the dying."

Late Game

     
       "I make problems... disappear."
     
       "Can't stop what's comin'."
     
       "Gonna carve my own path."
     
       "Stay outta my way!"
     
       "Playtime's over."
     
       "How about I just end this."
     
       "Let's end this."
     
       "Let's make this quick."
     
       "Time to do what's gotta be done."
     
       "Skill and steel will get the job done."
     
       "You will not stop me!"

       "Restraint's not really my thing."
     
       "The Fist of Shadow was my mom. I do things differently."
     
       "Take one life at a time. Fast. Clean."
     
       "We're gonna do this my way - quick and deadly."
     
       "I'll make this look like magic."
     
       "Magic's fine, steel's better."
     
       "So many enemies, so many knives."
     
       "It's not the killing I'm about, it's the cause."
     
       "The Kinkou couldn't control me. I do what they wouldn't."
     
       "There are over 300 pressure points on the human body. No one can protect 'em all."
     
       "Everyone's got a weakness, that's my target."
     
       "Forget balance... this is a reckoning."
     
       "The rules hold you back, leave 'em for someone who needs 'em."

       "Look, I don't wanna kill you, but I will."
     
       "Still time for you to do the smart thing: go home."

Trivia

Akali, the Fist of Shadow Akali, the Fist of Shadow

     
       "So many noobs... will matchmaking ever find true balance?" references (albeit in a rather tongue-in-cheek fashion) the criticism towards the matchmaking system, often matching up teams of wildly varying levels, causing lower-leveled players to be stomped on by higher-level ones.
        She is one of the few champions to say "noob", along with Sion, the Undead Champion Sion, the Undead Champion.
     
       "Tread lightly." resembles  
      Shen OriginalCircle.png "Tread carefully."

Akali, the Rogue Assassin Akali, the Rogue Assassin

     
       "Steel beats Rock, Taliyah Taliyah." references Pokemon, where Rock-type Pokémon are weak to Steel-type attacks.
     
       "Everyone dies, I just speed things up." resembles  
      Lucian OriginalCircle.png "Everybody dies. Some just need a little help".
    Akali shares quotes with:
         
          Akali OriginalCircle.png  
          Ahri OriginalCircle.png "Playtime's over."
     
       "The will comes from within, not from the blade." refers to pre-rework Irelia's Irelia's title, The Will of the Blade.
