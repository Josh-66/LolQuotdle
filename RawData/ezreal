       "Huh, could've sworn there was a hidden entrance around here somewhere…"
     
       "Where there's treasure, there's glory. And where there's glory… girls are watching."
     
       *sigh* "I don't care where here is. Just point me toward adventure."

       "Impossible comebacks are sorta my specialty."
     
       "The gauntlet's for show… the talent's all me."
     
       "Jarro Lightfeather never gives up. He learned that from me."
     
       "I'm at my best when the world's on the brink of annihilation."
     
       "Little piece of advice: If no one tells you something's impossible, then it's still possible. So go do it."
     
       "I rarely know what I'm looking for, but I always find it."
     
       "Never met a problem I couldn't blast away with magic… that I don't even understand."
     
       "True explorers follow the compass in their heart."
     
       "If I don't know the rules, then how can I be breaking them?"
     
       "I'm in my element, fighting evil. Life is good."
     
       "I hate the word 'steal.' I prefer 'liberate' or 'procure.'"
     
       "When you've got talent, there's not such thing as a lucky shot."
     
       "Oh, a plan. Yeah, I totally have one of those."

       "Nothing stops me. Except for Shuriman parasites. It was… not pretty."
     
       "I can't get hauled into wizard court again. Technically I don't have a permit for the gauntlet."
     
       "They really hate me in Shurima. And in Noxus. Demacia's lukewarm on me. Haven't been to Ionia yet, seems nice."
     
       "Last time I was in Shurima, I decoded some glyphs. Something about a… jackal head, end of times… the usual. I just wanted this ruby scarab. It looked great on my mantle."
     
       "Yeah, we'll liberate a priceless artifact or two. Kill some bad guys. Maybe save the world. Y'know, typical hero stuff. It'll be great."
     
       "It's not grave-robbing if you have a college degree. Which I do… *cough* not have a college degree."
     
       "I unearth the secrets of the past and sell them to the highest bidder. Does that make me a criminal? ...Don't answer that."
     
       "I use a fake name in Demacia: Jarro Lightfeather. Sentinel of Light, 8th Order. He's a national hero."
     
       "I don't read books about the world. I go out there and see it for myself."
     
       "No plan survives first contact with me."
     
       "There's an unspoken law in archaeology: Finders, keepers."
     
       "Feels like the whole world's gone crazy. Right on schedule."
     
       "Who needs a map?"
     
       "Some people call me a hero. Their word, not mine. But it does have a nice ring to it."
     
      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "Ooh, did I save my game before this?"
     
      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "I'm rated E for Ezreal."

      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "Ez tanks, locked and loaded."
     
      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "Uh, I hold the speed-running record for Hyper Crystal Dungeon. This is nothing."
     
      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "Woo! Just unlocked the 'Awesome at Everything' achievement!"
     
      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "Huh… where's the warp zone?"
     
      Ezreal ArcadeCircle.png "I'll beat this… League of Legends?"
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "Star Guardians for life! Except during Ezreal time. Gotta have my Ezreal time."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "How 'bout a serenade?"
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "Hmm, maybe I'll ask the First Star for a tuxedo… and some roses."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "I don't want to brag, but I'm somewhat of a cosmic sensation."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "Outshine everyone, and no one will see what you're up to."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "At least the First Star didn't put me in one of those sailor getups."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "The entire universe awaits us."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "If it's not made of stardust, it's not worth the effort."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "I can't believe they talked me into this."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "True Star Guardians never burn out."
     
      Ezreal StarGuardianCircle.png "Gotta admit it, the uniform's growing on me."
