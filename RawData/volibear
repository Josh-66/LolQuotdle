Movement
First Move

     
       "The land will exist far longer than warm-bloods."
     
       "Their bones are ash and soil. Mine rumble with wild thunder."
     
       "Follow me and we will bring down sky!"
     
       "This ground will tremble with the first storm!"
     
       "The land belongs to the wild. Today, we reclaim it with tooth and claw."
     
       "Gods do not beg. We take what is ours!"

Moving

     
       "I will unleash the Freljord."
     
       "We are all blood of the wild."
     
       "Hirnvel are sacred. Tree, soil, beast, blood!"
     
       "I split mountains with my roar!"
     
       "The creations of mortals fail. The wild remains."
     
       "My thunder shakes the foundations of the world!"
     
       "Many have tried to end me. A god."
     
       "With each step I take, the wind gathers, and the Vrestrom grows!"
     
       "The ursine speak for man and the wild responds."
     
       "When the night is cruel and dark..."
     
       "Men speak in small words. I speak in thunder!"
     
       "Once, history was writ by tooth and claw."
     
       "I will roar the world into stillness... so must it be."
     
       "They have lost their wild. I will guide them."
     
       "The soil hungers for blood."
     
       "To destroy is to free."
     
       "Warm-bloods rose on two legs... and forgot how to run."
     
       "Let the land thunder with my storm."
     
       "Battle boils the blood."
     
       "What happens when old wounds heal?"
     
       "Hmm. I taste iron on the wind... blood."
     
       "This place has been tamed. I will untame it!"
     
       "Let the storm follow in my wake."
     
       "Ice hides the fury within."
     
       "I carve my path with blood, and bone."

Long Move

     
       "Bones crunch. Blood drips. This is the way of old Vorrijaard."
     
       "My land was named by a god. It cannot be renamed by a coward."
     
       "They call me Valhir. The Volibear. Greatstorm. My true name is mine alone."
     
       "Clouds are the storm-cloak I wrap around my fur."
     
       "Even in a cowardly man the heart is wild. That is why it must be eaten last."
     
       "Thunder roars. Wind howls. Only fools ignore the call to battle."
     
       "I am Valhir of the first thunder, destroyer of the white mountain, carver of the five Fjords!"
     
       "They have forgotten the old ways. The old ways have not forgotten them."
     
       "The land slumbers, but it is not dead. With my roar, I wake it. With my thunder, I call it."
     
       "Raise your idols. Huddle beneath your stone trees! Today, I tear them all down."
     
       "Many have called to me. Avarosans. Frostguard. Winter's claw. They call no longer..."
     
       "In my dreams, I see bones frozen in ice. I wonder... if they are my own."
     
       "My blood is of the Vorrijaard, the land before the Freljord."
     
       "When my brother gave them fire, they forgot the fire of their own blood."
     
       "Darkening clouds. An omen to those who stand against the wild!"
     
       "My sisters are gods of ice and salt and ever-winter. And Ornn? A liar."
     
       "I am a god. I cannot die. But do I live if I am not in the hearts of warriors?"
     
       "I still taste their ancestors... stuck between my teeth."
