Movement
First Move

     
       "What a strange, wonderful world. I must make sure it stays that way."
     
       "Back when I was a doll, I really wanted to fight. This is my chance, my only one."
     
       "Alright everyone. First, we must win. After, I'll be glad to fix any clothes, hair, or broken spirits."
    "Scissors, needles, thread; tools of Isolde. She'll always be with me, and I with her."

Moving

     
       "I've certainly endured far worse than this."
     
       "Still can't believe I get to move my hands and feet all on my own!"
     
       "These turrets look strong, it'll be quite fun cutting them down!"
     
       "I'll make sure my allies feel the joy they deserve!"
     
       "I'll break as many needles as it takes to get this right."
     
       "I sense their resolve. No matter, mine will be stronger."
     
       "Don't waste a minute!"
     
       "I must hurry if I am to win."
     
       "Ahh, that brisk, fresh air!"
     
       "No time like the present!"
     
       "The memories I stitch here will be my own."
     
       "I've got to make each footprint mean something."
     
       "The wind at my back feels so good. I can't lose this. I won't."
     
       "What happens next, I get to decide!"
     
       "The Black Mist won't hurt anyone. I promise."
     
       "They're trying to stop me. Well, they can keep on trying!"
     
       "If only she were here to see this... see me."
     
       "I will experience everything like I never could before!"
     
       "The struggle is worth it."
     
       "Onward!"
     
       "This is better than a dream. It's real, and I won't ever forget it!"
     
       "Oh, what to do!"
     
       "No one said life would be easy. That is its charm, to be sure."
     
       "Seeing my dress twirl reminds me to smile."
    "Isolde. Wherever you are, I know you'll be alright."

Long Move

     
       "Bits of fabric can become something beautiful. My work here can do just the same!"
     
       "I remember when she sewed my dress with these scissors. Now, they cut a different cloth."
     
       "Oh, are those mountains beyond the cliffs? I've always wished to see one up close!"
     
       "It's called the Hallowed Mist, but how it feels matters more. Warm, safe, like nothing can hurt me."
     
       "This place certainly brings out the fight in everyone. Wouldn't be fair if I didn't present my best."
