Trivia

    Rammus has the least amount of quotes in the game (6) and is the only champion without a joke quote in the English localization.
        The French, German, Spanish, Polish, and Italian ones each feature a whole set of dialogue with taunts and jokes included.
     
       "OK." has earned meme status among the playerbase.
    Rammus' tone changes when issued an attack command.
