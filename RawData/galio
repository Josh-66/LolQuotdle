       "As a symbol of this great nation, I say... let's go mess up some mages!"
     
       "Know of any battles? Just looking to get my wings dirty."

       "I wish mountains had fists - that'd be a good fight."
     
       "Hmm, must be some powerful magic around here."
     
       "Somehow I always end up in the center of everything."
     
       "The guy that made me, he was pretty good right?"

       "I wish they'd chisel me a friend. Someone who won't break!"
     
       "I know, it's completely unfair. I didn't ask to be this impressive."
     
       "I always wonder what lies beyond this land. Something to fight, I hope."
     
       "I am not going back on the pedestal, not yet... "
     
       "They made me to stop magic, and yet I hate when it's gone."
     
       "I sleep, I wake, I break things"
     
       "Whoa, I didn't know I had a tail!"
     
       "Do I get to crush that? Oh, please say yes!"
     
       "I don't know why life chose me, but I'm glad it did."
     
       "I'm supposed to be a symbol. Of what, I'm not so sure."
     
       "It's hard to be a symbol, when you've got a soul."
     
       "Let's move! I've got people to inspire!"
     
       "It's not easy when everyone looks up to you."
     
       "Can someone please get the pigeons out of my head?"
     
       "Ah, mages. I love the way they squish."
     
       "I don't break easy."
     
       "I fought a house once. I'm pretty sure I won."
     
       "People vanish! And new ones take their places! It must be magic."
     
       "The best defense is me."
     
       "The best offense is a good magic absorbing colossus."
     
       "I love walking, it sounds like thunder!"
     
       "Ah, the world, it goes by in a flash."
     
       "It's time to move! Shake off the moss."
     
       "I'm going, you try moving three hundred tons."
     
       "They just don't make doorways big enough."
     
       "Going to sleep means saying goodbye."
     
       "Which way's the fun?"
     
       "What should I break next?"
     
       "They say I'm all made of petricite, I say I'm all guts!"
     
       "I fell in love with a crag-beast once. Oh... wasn't meant to be."
     
       "I haven't been to many places, so I might as well like this one."
     
       "Let me do the heavy lifting."
     
       "Get behind me, huddled masses!"
     
       "People live such tiny lives!"
     
       "I'm a big man, with big needs."
     
       "One people year is fifty Galio-years."
     
       "I love Demacia! It's the only place I've been."
     
       "At last a change of scenery!"
