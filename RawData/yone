Movement
First Move

     
       "Before, I chased a wayward gale. Now I hunt a storm of darkness."
     
       "Many mistake me for the nightmares I slay. Hmph, let them."
     
       "In this cursed second life, where does the mask end, and I begin?"
     
       "They look at me and see only the mask."
     
       "The Azakana have spread like a plague since the Noxian invasion. My work... never ends."
     
      Yone SpiritBlossomCircle.png "Haunted by a past I cannot change."
     
      Yone SpiritBlossomCircle.png "A festival of flowers to remember those lost... I think I'd rather be forgotten."
     
      Yone SpiritBlossomCircle.png "In life, we died at each other's hands. How can I bear to face my brother now?"

Moving

     
       "Azakana lurk everywhere. I will end their depredations."
     
       "Some days I forget what lies behind this mask."
     
       "Sleep is not for the weak, but for the blessed."
     
       "Demons take many forms, I hunt them all the same."
     
       "The spirit realm is... strange. A mirror, an inverse, of our own."
     
       "I do not hunt to kill."
     
       "No fate, nor destiny. Only tomorrow."
     
       "Now, there is only the hunt."
     
       "Sometimes, to save someone, you must fight them."
     
       "I'm not here to save their souls."
     
       "Honor once bound me above all else."
     
       "Fear, once named, controls no one."
     
       "The road to ruin, I've walked it once before."
     
       "I do what must be done."
     
       "What does one do with an abundance of masks?"
     
       "Forgiveness is... complicated."
     
       "The hunt... it never ends."
     
       "Without a banquet of sorrow, an Azakana starves."
     
       "No sleep, no rest... there is no time."
     
       "Rare is the person who shows their true face."
     
       "The haunted cower behind polite fictions."
     
       "Azakana abound."
     
       "Between uncertainty and fear, the Azakana prowl."
     
       "Walk both realms."
     
       "Forget the past, it only clouds the future."
     
       "Humans lie, swords... speak truth."

Long Move

     
       "Wear a mask long enough, and you forget the face beneath."
     
       "On a cliff by the sea, I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams."
     
       "A broken heart, an anxious mind, all can attract the Azakana."
     
       "Azakana trap their victims in an vicious cycle of emotion. Doubt breeds doubt, fear breeds fear, and the Azakana feasts."
     
       "Long before blades and sorcery are needed, words... can save a soul."
     
       "So many try to flee their burdens. Fleeing is impossible!"
     
       "Bound to the world of the living. *sighs* Denied the peace of death..."
     
       "Every aspect of an Azakana is a stroke. Each stroke forms a character, revealing their true name..."
     
       "One blade carries the weight of my past. The other, holds the key to my future..."
     
       "When we met in the spirit realm, this Azakana upon my face knew me!"
     
       "Through the mask, I see their truths laid bare. Yet my own - *scoffs* - dance just out of reach..."

Trivia

Yone, the Unforgotten Yone, the Unforgotten

    Yone Yone and Yasuo Yasuo share not only a backstory and a similar playstyle, but also similar quotes:
         
          Yone OriginalCircle.png "Sleep is not for the weak, but for the blessed." and  
          Yasuo OriginalCircle.png "Sleep is for the guiltless."
         
          Yone OriginalCircle.png "The road to ruin, I've walked it once before." and  
          Yasuo OriginalCircle.png "The road to ruin is shorter than you think."
         
          Yone OriginalCircle.png "Kindness is a luxury!" and  
          Yasuo OriginalCircle.png "Virtue is no more than a luxury."
         
          Yone OriginalCircle.png "Forget the past, it only clouds the future." and  
          Yasuo OriginalCircle.png "Hmph. One step ahead of the past."
         
          Yone OriginalCircle.png "A broken mask meets a dishonored blade." and  
          Yasuo OriginalCircle.png "An unworthy blade meets a cursed mask."
     
       "On a cliff by the sea I found the strangest spirit. It walked on four legs and spoke of dreams." is Yone's Yone's perspective in  
      Lillia SpiritBlossomCircle.png "I met the strangest human in my forest. D-Do you think they're here? I still have their dream."
     
       "Nothing personal!" is a reference to "Nothing personal, kid."
