Trivia

    Corki uses many aviator slang phrases when he speaks, several of which humorously convey much more vulgar language. Some quotes also include NATO phonetic.
        Blackshoe: A derogatory term for non-flying personnel as World War II aviators traditionally wore brown shoes.
        Bogey: An unidentified potentially hostile aircraft.
        Charlie Foxtrot: Cluster F***. A term used in a situation in which everything has gone completely wrong.
        Delta Sierra: Dumb S***. An insult towards someone who completely blunders something.
        Lima Oscar Lima: 'L.O.L.' ('laugh out loud', 'League of Legends')
        Nugget: An aviator on his first tour (a rookie/newbie)
        Sortie: A military mission or attack performed by a single plane.
        Speed of Heat: Very, very fast
        Spooled Up: Excited. Spooling up is also the act of bringing an aircraft's engines to idling revolutions per minute (RPM) to prepare them for takeoff.
        Up To Snuff: To be aware of what is going on.
        Whiskey Delta: Weak D***. An insult aimed at an aviator who caves under pressure.
     
       "This is Major Tom to Ground Control" references Space Oddity by David Bowie.
