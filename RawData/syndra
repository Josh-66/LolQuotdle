Trivia

    Syndra is the second champion to have quotes when she levels up an ability, the first being Vayne Vayne upon leveling Silver Bolts Silver Bolts.
    Syndra shares a quote with Karma Karma: "By force of will".
    Syndra's joke is a triple entendre.
        The primary play on words is regarding her lore where she was deemed mentally unbalanced by her Ionian elders (as balance is a defining virtue in Ionian culture), and stands upon on her dark spheres to prove that she "has balance."
        It also refers to Syndra's champion balance as she was reportedly overpowered during development.
