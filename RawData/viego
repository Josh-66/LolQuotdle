Movement
First Move

     
       "She waits for me beyond the mist. My queen. My love. My black and broken heart."
     
       "No price is too great. No atrocity beyond my reach. For her, I will do anything."
     
       "Submission or death for all who live. In the end, it matters not. I will see her face again."

Moving

     
       "It hurts, my heart. It hurts so much."
     
       "I want precious little, yet I am forced to kill for it."
     
       "Soon, this long cruel night will end. But not yet."
     
       "My forces scour the world. Nothing will escape."
     
       "We were beautiful once."
     
       "The curve of her lips, the softness of her smile."
     
       "She was the star that lit my path. Without her... darkness."
     
       "What is a wraith but the ravenous shadow of a man?"
     
       "Stand against me. Call me villain. Die."
     
       "I feel her calling out 'Viego, save me!'"
     
       "I will take, and take, until there is nothing left but her."
     
       "The Shadow Isles are just the beginning."
     
       "The mist is my great unending sadness."
     
       "Her eyes were portraits of a world without my cruelty."
     
       "What is lost is never lost to me."
     
       "This mist has but one cure... and I will find her."
     
       "And so it was that love was the gravest sin of all."
     
       "It is such a small and fragile thing, love."
     
       "There is no salvation from the dark, for the dark is me."
     
       "Isolde is gone. Yet I remain."
     
       "I am already a monster suited for the horrors I must inflict."
     
       "The world denied my happiness. Now, all will die."

Long Move

     
       "Isolde was my life. Viego died when she did and the ruined king was born."
     
       "The black mist flows from me like a tide. At times, it ebbs, but now we surge forward."
     
       "I remember her sinking beneath the waters... and then... and then..."
     
       "A world that would rob me of beauty is a world that deserves destruction."
     
       "Hate me if you must. Until she returns to my arms, all will be brought to ruin."
     
       "I will rip her from the jaws of death. Fate cannot stop me. Nothing can."
     
       "A crown lost long ago, reborn in unlife, ripped away from his only love."
