Movement
First Move

     
       "Aphelios… I hear you. I know what you sacrifice."
     
       "Even from across the celestial veil… I will be with you, brother."
     
       "It always starts with pain. We can only do this together, Aphelios."
     
       "Your life upon the altar, brother… I will not betray it."
     
       "With every step, two steps. With every breath, two breaths."

     
      Aphelios NightbringerCircle.png "Order fights for light. Chaos fights for darkness. In the moon, we have found both: a way to survive."
     
      Aphelios NightbringerCircle.png "We are meant to hate each other. But we will show them all, wicked and divine, that we are stronger together."
     
      Aphelios NightbringerCircle.png "Will they still call you 'fiend' when they die, looking in your eyes? Or will they see the savior I see, Aphelios?"

Moving

     
       "You knew this would not be easy, the way forward written in scars."
     
       "You walk the path of darkness, but you do not walk it alone, brother."
     
       "Remember what you have learned, brother."
     
       "When your steps falter, brother, follow my voice."
     
       "Find your orbit, brother."
     
       "Do not look back, Aphelios."
     
       "You are the weapon the Lunari need."
     
       "By my word, you walk into the night."
     
       "You are not alone. Remember our promise."
     
       "I am your sister. I am listening."
     
       "I'm never further than a whisper echoing in silence."
     
       "Even when I close my eyes… I'll never look away."
     
       "I am with you… shining above."
     
       "Through your eyes, I see such wonders…"
     
       "Beneath the mask of silence… I know your true face, brother."
     
       "Again and again, I see you reach… for me."
     
       "How can I help you when I put your life at risk?"
     
       "From our fortress, I will guide you. I promise."
     
       "I beseech the moon to protect you."
     
       "I am right. This is what the moon tells me."
     
       "Walk where I cannot."
     
       "We must find each other before every first light."
     
       "We're in this together. Darkness and light."
     
       "As light reveals our path, so will darkness."
     
       "The brighter my light, the stronger your shadow."
     
       "Darkness is not heresy. It lies within us all."
     
       "We cannot let fear trap us in twilight."
     
       "Our destiny is hidden in the night."
     
       "The moon shines brightest in darkness."
     
       "The dawn will know the night's silence."
     
       "Each of us, an offering."
     
       "All we ask is for a witness to our sorrow."
     
       "We walk through violence. Born of shadow. Born of light."
     
       Aphelios hyperventilates.

Long Move

     
       "Even when the moon is new, it is there. A whisper to the shadows of your soul… I am with you."
     
       "It is as the moon revealed, Aphelios. As beautiful. As terrifying."
     
       "Our path is set between the last breaths taken by our enemies."
     
       "You will make death more than death, brother. You will make it holy."
     
       "We cannot touch the moon. But its light can touch us. Shouldn't that be enough? Light, on our fingers…"
     
       "Without pain, we would not need faith. The moon would not need us. We would not need each other, Aphelios."
     
       "The fortress is quiet. If only you could be here, Phel. You would make this stone seem loud."
     
       "If pain is what awaits us in the darkness, brother… we must run to it, unafraid."
     
       "What we want, what we need, what we must do… I envy the ignorant."
     
       "The Solari call us heretics, but when darkness comes, brother, they will need our light."
     
       "You cannot feel the tear running down your cheek. I cannot wipe it away…"
     
       "Our thoughts touch… impossibly close. Which of us am I?"
     
       "The fortress looms around me. It is everything. It is the only thing."
     
       "You make yourself a weapon, so you do not have to feel. But you are not a weapon; you are my brother."
     
       "Phel… You have made every movement a thousand times. Until you bleed. Until you do not have to think."
     
       "The pain makes you numb. But I can still feel, brother. I know the truth that pain hides."
     
       "I see further through the celestial veil. What we call truth is shadow."

Trivia

    Aphelios Aphelios can't talk when he consumes poison to connect to his sister. Because of this, all the in-game voice lines are done by Alune Alune.
        The poison only constricts and agonizes his throat, so while he cannot speak, Aphelios is still able to make basic grunts and gasping sounds in game.
