Trivia

Original Twisted Fate Original Twisted Fate

    Many of his lines are gambling and card game-related references and double-entendres.
    "I'm one of a kind" references both his individuality and the 'of a kind' hands in the card game Poker.
    His taunt "Only two Jokers in the deck, and I get dealt you" references the Joker card in card games.
        In the context of the quote, he references how unlucky he was to have dealt the person he is speaking to since drawing a Joker from a deck of 54 cards (including two Jokers) is roughly 3.70%.
    His taunt "Only a fool plays the hand he's dealt" referencing the act of playing (using) the hand (set of cards) that are dealt (initially given) to them, which is considered a novice move in most situations in various card games.
    "I never bluff" references the act of bluffing in Poker.
    "Let's raise the stakes" references raising the bet in Poker.
    "Let it ride" references both the term of 'letting it ride' (choosing not to withdraw part of their wager) and the card game based on Poker, Let It Ride.
