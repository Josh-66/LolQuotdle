Trivia

    Bard is the second champion to have both a voiceover with no actual spoken words as well as a music-themed one, the first for each being Rek'Sai Rek'Sai and Sona Sona, respectively.
        He communicates by melody (akin to The Traveler from Journey) with some of them resembling Whale calls.
    Bard's voiceover is based on a system that plays certain lines depending on the number of Meeps Meeps currently traveling with him, with specific lines for 0/1/2/3/4.[1]
        His early voiceover prototypes used Bassoon, Contrabassoon, and Bass clarinet. The final version has 4 parts.
            Alpenhorn
            Egyptian flutes
            Verbed out Piano tone clusters and strings
            A Synthesizer called Zebra and programmed to cycle through the harmonic and/or overtone series.
            This mixture is meant to give Bard a sense of other-worldliness.[2][3]
                Other instruments recorded were:
                    Tibetan Singing bowls (various shapes and sizes)
                    Tibetan chimes (various shapes and sizes)
                    Tibetan Gong
                    Tibetan Cymbal
                    Trombone (performed)
                    Trombone mouth piece
                    Trombone mouth piece buzzed through a garden hose
                    Bowed Cymbals
                    Various ethnic flutes and reed instruments
    Although Bard himself does not have a voice actor, his Meeps Meeps do.
        Reflecting this, when a Meep Meep spawns, they will occasionally whisper "Utora", who is one of Bard's audio designer, Riot Utora.[4]
