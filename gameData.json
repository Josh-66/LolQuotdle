No one remembers who built this place; no one knows its purpose; no one but me. Long before Ashe and Sejuani, before magic shattered the broken peaks, before the desert swallowed Shurima… it was the time of the three sisters. We were so young back then; Avarossa, Serylda, and me, Lissandra. Back then, the frozen watchers lived here. I do not know where they came from, but I know they were powerful. They gave us gifts, shared their magic, made us immortal… they named us Iceborn. In return we gave them whatever they desired; this mighty fortress, a vast empire; our loyalty. These were a small price to pay. Avarosa did not see it that way. Like a spoiled child, she cried out for freedom. She demanded choice. She sowed the seeds of rebellion and betrayal. This place is where it happened. On one side the frozen watchers; on the other, Avarosa and her Iceborn horde. Many Iceborn died that day, but in the end the watchers fell. Avarosa drove them howling into the abyss. I never forgave her. I had my revenge, but that is another story.\""],"lucian":["\"Everybody dies.

Crap. What was I supposed to do?\"","\"Nothing important should be taken seriously.\"","\"War is in the dance.\"","\"Consequences only matter if I don't get away.\"","\"We are seen dancing and thought insane - by those who can't hear the music.\"","\"Alright, let's go!

Yeah, I should... probably be running.\"","\"I look around these forests and I see freedom. I hear the music.\"","\"Crap. I totally forgot why I'm here.\"","\"I am only as wild as magic.\"","\"Magic is supposed to be scary. Love is supposed to hurt.

More than I can remember. They kept none.\"","\"Humans talk about their treaties. We talk about their lies.\"","\"Long ago, our kind danced upon the mountains like flames. Now only the embers remain.\"","\"I dance because I'm free!\"","\"The only way to understand magic is to plunge into it, move with it, dance and dance!\"","\"I'm getting impatient.\"","\"Gotta get myself hyped, okay... one, two... one, two... woo! Alright!\"","\"The humans call it battle. It's just a dance.\"","\"I feel like my allies aren't recognising how amazing my cloak is! I mean, seriously!

Thankfully, I can improvise.\"","\"They're gonna' try and test me? Haha!\"","\"Danger is as fun as you let it be.\"","\"I am definitely more confident in dangerous situations.\"","\"I have got to stop talking to myself. Damnit, Xayah, where are you?\"","\"You're only given a little spark of madness. You mustn't lose it.\"","\"I can't wait to see what I'm going to do.\"","\"There's wildness in the bees and the flowers. It's just a fury humans don't see.\"","\"I am Vastaya. I am born of magic. This is my destiny.\"","\"Is my cloak right? Yes it is! I was worried there for a second.\"","\"Magic isn't supposed to be safe.\"","\"They're scared of darkness, they're scared of magic. They are scared of where I'm from.\"","\"They ain't seen moves like mine.\"","\"It's magic that's wild. I'm just here for the party.\"","\"For humans, magic is like fire. For us, it is water and air.\"","\"Ladies and gentleman, I am here to entertain! Myself, mostly - but you too!\"","\"Humans claim it is theirs. They fence us away and cover it in refuse.\"","\"It don't take a lot of words to tell the truth.\"","\"Our people are bleeding. My lady's gonna' heal them.\"","\"I don't want a world that's safe.\"","\"I don't want a war - but I want to be free.\"","\"What human's call magic, we call life.\"","\"I'm here! I'm gone, I am so gone.\"","\"I can't die looking this good!\"","\"I am a chronic line-stepper.\"","\"I dance because I'm free.\"","\"If Xayah says someone has to die, they die - and they deserved it.\"","\"Woo! I am so into this! What is this?\"","\"If it don't get out of control, it ain't a party.\"","\"I think they underestimate my charm. How is that even possible?\"","\"I'm so fine, I gotta kiss myself!\"","\"They think they can catch me.\"","\"I don't do safe.\"","\"The universe loves me.\"","\"They want us in cages. We refuse.\"","\"I need my love to hurt. I need the world to be scary. I don't apologise for it! I feel good!\"","\"I'm gonna' burn this place down, then help them build it back up - so I can burn it again!\"","\"I dance so fine I kill.\"","\"Xayah? Hey! Damn, where is she? I hate it when she leaves.\"","\"Without wild magic, we have no children, we have no future.\"","\"When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.\"","\"I do not wish to kill the mortals. I want them to hear the music.\"","\"The humans will never understand our kind until they hear the song.\"","\"I will make them dance. I will make them hear.\"","\" Hey, Xayah.\"","\"Yeah?\"","\"You sexy.\"","\"Keep them distracted.\"","\"That shouldn't be a problem.\"","\"You okay?\"","\"I'm fine.\"","\"You're pushing yourself too hard.\"","\"It has to be done.\"","\"Where are we going?\"","\"You forgot the plan.\"","\"No, I... yeah. Hey, have you seen this cape?\"","\"You remember the Aphae waterfall?\"","\"Yeah.\"","\"I'd like to go there again.\"","\"Well, try not to die then.\"","\"Darling?\"","\"Yes?\"","\"Pay attention to me.\"","\"What the hell were you thinking?\"","\"Back there?\"","\"Yes.\"","\"I wasn't. I never think. Ugh... thinking.\"","\"How can humans not hear the magic?\"","\"They're too busy building things.\"","\"Why?\"","\"Because... they're afraid.\"","\"Thanks.\"","\"For what?\"","\"Not saying 'I told you so.'\"","\"Okay, last time, it was totally my fault.\"","\"What was?\"","\"Good answer.\"","\"You going to marry me today?\"","\"Ask me again tomorrow.\"","\"I always do.\"","\"Do you love me because I'm beautiful, or because I'm sexy?\"","\"Not now!\"","\"Love is so cruel!\"","\"What's after this?\"","\"Another road, another horizon.\"","\"Hm. Good.\"","\"It's gonna' be okay.\"","\"We can do this.\"","\"Hey, I know that.\"","\"You know I love you.\"","\"What we have is greater than some human word.\"","\"Did you notice the sky?\"","\"It's lovely.\"","\"Not as beautiful as you.\"","\"I am R-r-r-akan!\"","\"Ugh, what's with the accent?\"","\"I'm... trying something new. Do you like it?\"","\"No. No, I do not.\"","\"If you need me, whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?\"","\"Hubba hubba.\"","\"No, that's not whistling.\"","\"If you don't want to do this... \"","\"No! I want to!\"","\"You're only here because of me.\"","\"... nah. Freedom fighting is a good look for me.\"","\"What are those things humans wear on their feet?\"","\"Shoes.\"","\"I need shoes. Red ones. I need them so bad.\"","\"Did I tell you I love you?\"","\"Yes... but say it anyway.\"","\"I love you.\"","\"Why do you never say yes?\"","\"'cause then... I wouldn't get to hear you ask.\"","\"Can we just stay here?\"","\"We must keep moving.\"","\"Aw... \"","\"Xayah? I think we got a problem... \"","\"Think, or know?\"","\"I... know we got a problem?\"","\"I'm so tired... \"","\"You gotta rest, honey.\"","\"Everyone is depending on me.\"","\"Everyone can wait.\"","\"What would you do if I died?\"","\"I would... burn this world to the ground and build a castle from the ashes, where I would live alone forever.\"","\"Aw... that's sweet.\"","\"I think scars are sexy.\"","\"Okay. I'll get more.\"","\"Where do we go?\"","\"Wherever our hearts desire.\"","\"How do you like me today?\"","\"More than yesterday, less than tomorrow.\"","\"Do I make you happy, Rakan?\"","\"Every day of my life.\"","\"I'm lucky to have you.\"","\"No. I'm the lucky one.\"","\"I swear, you will be the death of me.\"","\"I'm fine with that.\"","\"Me too.\"","\"If we get separated, I'll find you.\"","\"We won't get separated.\"","\"You're already wandering off.\"","\"No, I'm not! ... only a little.\"","\"You are stunning and beautiful... \"","\"Why, thank you, darling.\"","\"Yes. I was... definitely talking about you, honey.\"","\"I need you to be more careful.\"","\"If anybody's gonna' die first, it's gonna' be me. I can't see you die.
